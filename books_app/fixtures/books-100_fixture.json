The narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension and his demonstration of a tabletop model machine for travelling through it. He reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person through time, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator.\nIn the new narrative, the Time Traveller tests his device with a journey that takes him to A.D. 802,701, where he meets the Eloi, a society of small, elegant, childlike adults. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, doing no work and having a frugivorous diet. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline, and he speculates that they are a peaceful, communist society, the result of humanity conquering nature with technology, and subsequently evolving to adapt to an environment in which strength and intellect are no longer advantageous to survival.\nReturning to the site where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing and eventually concludes that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. Luckily, he had removed the machine's levers before leaving it (the time machine being unable to travel through time without them). Later in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Within their dwellings, he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise possible. He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi, and the downtrodden working classes have become the brutal light-fearing Morlocks. Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the Morlock tunnels, learning that due to a lack of any other means of sustenance, they feed on the Eloi. His revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers. The Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak.\nMeanwhile, he saves an Eloi named Weena from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days. He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum, where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to get back his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time. Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest, and they are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, and Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost in the fire, and the Time Traveler is devastated over his loss.\nThe Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the time machine as bait to capture the Traveller, not understanding that he will use it to escape. He reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make short jumps through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out.\nOverwhelmed, he goes back to the machine and returns to Victorian time, arriving at his laboratory just three hours after he originally left. Interrupting dinner, he relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two strange white flowers Weena had put in his pocket. The original narrator then takes over and relates that he returned to the Time Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for another journey. After promising to return in a short period of time, the narrator reveals that after 3 years of waiting, the Time Traveller has never returned.","genres":[],"copyright":"Copyrighted.

Wells is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.\nThe Time Machine has been adapted into three feature films of the same name, as well as two television versions, and a large number of comic book adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media productions.","content_cleaned":true,"classes":["to-read","currently-reading","classics","science-fiction","sci-fi","fiction","classic","favorites","time-travel","fantasy","owned","scifi","books-i-own","kindle","dystopia","sci-fi-fantasy","literature","adventure","dystopian","steampunk","sf","1001-books","novels","ebook","19th-century","ebooks","owned-books","audiobook","1001","british","classic-literature","scifi-fantasy","to-buy","audiobooks","english","library","my-ebooks","fantasy-sci-fi","school","classics-to-read","default","adult","science-fiction-fantasy","h-g-wells","1001-books-to-read-before-you-die","speculative-fiction","e-books","novel","science","classic-fiction","favourites","my-library","british-literature","e-book","my-books","victorian","audio","adult-fiction","book-club","books","read-for-school","classic-lit","sci-fi-and-fantasy","read-in-2015","to-read-classics","i-own","nook","read-in-2014","read-in-2016","english-literature","novella","fantasy-scifi","audio-books","wish-list","1800s","england","kindle-books","own-it","classic-sci-fi","1001-books-you-must-read-before-you","historical","read-in-2013","read-in-english","horror","young-adult","ciencia-ficciï¿½n","read-in-2017","sf-masterworks","british-lit","audible","historical-fiction","owlcrate","uk","audio-book","post-apocalyptic","re-read","future","sf-fantasy","travel","time"],"content_available":false,"n_authors":1},{"content_name":"36.txt.utf-8","isbn":"0375759239","original_title":"The War of the Worlds","year":1898,"author_name":"H.

The first falls near Woking and is regarded as a curiosity rather than a danger until the Martians climb out of it and kill many of the gaping crowd with a Heat-Ray. These unearthly creatures have heads four feet in diameter and colossal round bodies, and by manipulating two terrifying machines – the Handling Machine and the Fighting Machine – they are as versatile as humans and at the same time insuperable. They cause boundless destruction. The inhabitants of the Earth are powerless against them, and it looks as if the end of the World has come. But there is one factor which the Martians, in spite of their superior intelligence, have not reckoned on.

G. Wells first serialised in 1897 in the UK by Pearson's Magazine and in the United States by Cosmopolitan magazine. The novel's first appearance in hardcover was in 1898 from publisher William Heinemann of London. Written between 1895 and 1897, it is one of the earliest stories that detail a conflict between mankind and an extraterrestrial race. The novel is the first-person narrative of both an unnamed protagonist in Surrey and of his younger brother in London as southern England is invaded by Martians. The novel is one of the most commented-on works in the science fiction canon.\nThe plot has been related to invasion literature of the time. The novel has been variously interpreted as a commentary on evolutionary theory, British imperialism, and generally Victorian superstitions, fears and prejudices. At the time of publication, it was classified as a scientific romance, like Wells' earlier novel The Time Machine. The War of the Worlds has been both popular (having never been out of print) and influential, spawning half a dozen feature films, radio dramas, a record album, various comic book adaptations, a television series, and sequels or parallel stories by other authors. It has even influenced the work of scientists, notably Robert H. Goddard, who, inspired by the book, invented both the liquid fuelled rocket and multistage rocket, which resulted in the Apollo 11 Moon landing 71 years later.","content_cleaned":true,"classes":["to-read","currently-reading","classics","science-fiction","sci-fi","fiction","classic","favorites","owned","scifi","books-i-own","fantasy","kindle","sci-fi-fantasy","literature","sf","horror","1001-books","aliens","default","novels","owned-books","19th-century","ebook","ebooks","1001","audiobook","war","library","british","classic-literature","fantasy-sci-fi","to-buy","h-g-wells","audiobooks","english","my-library","classics-to-read","scifi-fantasy","my-ebooks","dystopian","science-fiction-fantasy","1001-books-to-read-before-you-die","novel","favourites","books","my-books","british-literature","e-book","adventure","adult","dystopia","school","50-books-to-read-before-you-die","science","audio","speculative-fiction","i-own","apocalyptic","e-books","sci-fi-and-fantasy","alien-invasion","nook","wish-list","classic-fiction","classic-sci-fi","to-read-classics","audible","england","victorian","sf-fantasy","own-it","english-literature","adult-fiction","kindle-books","audio-books","sf-masterworks","1001-books-you-must-read-before-you","thriller","classic-lit","post-apocalyptic","unfinished","science-fiction-and-fantasy","abandoned","1800s","mars","the-classics","movies","ciencia-ficciï¿½n","own-to-read","steampunk","unread","read-in-2013","fantasy-scifi","did-not-finish","read-in-english","read-in-2016","home-library","apocalypse","book-club"],"content_available":true,"n_authors":1},{"content_name":"62.txt.utf-8","isbn":"0143104888","original_title":"A Princess of Mars","year":1912,"author_name":"Edgar Rice Burroughs","images_urls":[],"language_code":"en-GB","images":["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Princess_of_Mars_large.jpg","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Under_the_Moons_of_Mars.jpg"],"id":3,"category":"Sound","plot":"John Carter, a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War, goes prospecting in Arizona immediately after the war's end.

While attempting to evade pursuit by hiding in a sacred cave, he is mysteriously transported to Mars, called \"Barsoom\" by its inhabitants. Carter finds that he has great strength and superhuman agility in this new environment as a result of its lesser gravity and lower atmospheric pressure. He soon falls in with a nomadic tribe of Green Martians, or Tharks, as the planet's warlike, six-limbed, green-skinned inhabitants are known. Thanks to his strength and martial prowess, Carter rises to a high position in the tribe and earns the respect and eventually the friendship of Tars Tarkas, one of the Thark chiefs.\nThe Tharks subsequently capture Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, a member of the humanoid red Martian race. The red Martians inhabit a loose network of city-states and control the desert planet's canals, along which its agriculture is concentrated. Carter rescues Dejah Thoris from the green men in a bid to return her to her people.\nSubsequently, Carter becomes embroiled in the political affairs of both the red and green Martians in his efforts to safeguard Dejah Thoris, eventually leading a horde of Tharks against the city-state of Zodanga, the historic enemy of Helium. Winning Dejah Thoris' heart, he becomes Prince of Helium, and the two live happily together for nine years. However, the sudden breakdown of the Atmosphere Plant that sustains the planet's waning air supply endangers all life on Barsoom. In a desperate attempt to save the planet's inhabitants, Carter uses a secret telepathic code to enter the factory, bringing an engineer along who can restore its functionality. Carter then succumbs to asphyxiation, only to awaken back on Earth, left to wonder what has become of Barsoom and his beloved.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"A Princess of Mars","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Princess_of_Mars","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.8,"rating_count":34582,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40395.A_Princess_of_Mars","found":true,"year":1912},"similar_books":["Almuric","The Time Traders (Time Traders/ Ross Murdock, #1)","Mosses from an Old Manse","Triplanetary (Lensman, #1)","Lest Darkness Fall","Starman Jones","The Man of Bronze (Doc Savage, #1)","Dwellers in the Mirage","What Mad Universe","Swords Against Wizardry (Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, #4)","The Ginger Star (The Book of Skaith, #1)","Little Fuzzy (Fuzzy Sapiens, #1)","Metropolis","Fury","John Carter of Mars: Warlord of Mars"],"description":"Her oval face was beautiful in the extreme, her every feature finely chisled and exquisite, her eyes large and lustrous and her head surmounted by a mass of coal black, waving hair, caught loosely into a strange yet becoming coiffure.

It was first serialized in the pulp magazine All-Story Magazine from February–July, 1912. Full of swordplay and daring feats, the novel is considered a classic example of 20th-century pulp fiction. It is also a seminal instance of the planetary romance, a subgenre of science fantasy that became highly popular in the decades following its publication. Its early chapters also contain elements of the Western. The story is set on Mars, imagined as a dying planet with a harsh desert environment. This vision of Mars was based on the work of the astronomer Percival Lowell, whose ideas were widely popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nThe Barsoom series inspired a number of well-known 20th-century science fiction writers, including Jack Vance, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert A. Heinlein, and John Norman. The series was also inspirational for many scientists in the fields of space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life, including Carl Sagan, who read A Princess of Mars when he was a child.","content_cleaned":true,"classes":["to-read","currently-reading","science-fiction","sci-fi","fantasy","classics","fiction","adventure","favorites","scifi","kindle","classic","owned","sci-fi-fantasy","sf","pulp","ebook","series","ebooks","romance","audiobook","barsoom","scifi-fantasy","my-ebooks","audiobooks","edgar-rice-burroughs","books-i-own","mars","novels","aliens","default","fantasy-sci-fi","science-fiction-fantasy","audio","science-fantasy","speculative-fiction","read-in-2012","e-book","e-books","sword-and-planet","planetary-romance","library","pulp-fiction","space","action","owned-books","young-adult","space-opera","adult","abandoned","20th-century","read-2012","classic-sci-fi","kindle-books","american","action-adventure","to-buy","novel","1910s","sci-fi-and-fantasy","maybe","audible","sf-fantasy","fantasy-scifi","book-club","burroughs","literature","coursera","audio-book","john-carter","science","audio-books","favourites","science-fiction-and-fantasy","my-library","did-not-finish","nook","books","reviewed","read-in-2014","to-read-sci-fi","wish-list","sff","sword-and-sorcery","public-domain","adult-fiction","read-in-2013","fantascienza","appendix-n","classic-literature","american-literature","librivox","classic-science-fiction","own-it","guardian-1000","barsoom-series","burroughs-edgar-rice","2015-reading-challenge","fantasy-science-fiction","fun"],"content_available":false,"n_authors":1},{"content_name":"31547.txt.utf-8","original_title":"Youth (Asimov short story)","language_code":"eng","author_name":"Isaac Asimov","images_urls":["http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31547/31547-h/images/001.png","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31547/31547-h/images/002.png","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31547/31547-h/images/003.png","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31547/31547-h/images/004-1.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31547/31547-h/images/004-2.jpg"],"year":1952,"images":[],"id":4,"category":"Text","plot":"Slim is a boy whose astronomer father is visiting the country estate of an important industrialist.

This is maintained through a combination of infanticide and government-assisted suicide - in short, in order for someone to be born, someone must first volunteer to die. As a result, births are few and far between, and deaths occur primarily by accident.\nThe scene is a waiting room at the Chicago Lying-In Hospital, where Edward K. Wehling, Jr. is faced with the situation that his wife is about to give birth to triplets, but he has found only one person - his maternal grandfather - who will volunteer to die. A painter on a stepladder is redecorating the room with a mural depicting famous doctors and nurses - in particular, Dr. Benjamin Hitz, the hospital's Chief Obstetrician. Leora Duncan, from the Service Division of the Federal Bureau of Termination, arrives to pose for the mural. The mural is a picture of a garden that's well taken care of. It is a metaphor for the United States at that time. Later, Dr. Hitz enters the scene, conversing with everyone but the painter of the mural.\nIt becomes apparent to all that Wehling is in a state of despair, wanting not to send his grandfather and two of his children to death. Dr. Hitz questions Wehling's belief in the system, and tries to make Wehling feel better by explaining how the surviving child will \"live on a happy, roomy, clean, rich planet.\" Suddenly, Wehling draws a revolver and kills Dr. Hitz, Leora Duncan, and himself - \"making room for all three children.\"\nThe painter, who is about two hundred years old, is left to reflect on the scene, and thinks about life, war, plague, and starvation. Descending the stepladder, he initially takes the revolver, intending to kill himself with it, but he can't do it. Instead he calls the Bureau of Termination to make an appointment.

He exclusively uses plural pronoun(s) (\"we\", \"our\", \"they\") to refer to himself and others. He was raised like all children in his society, away from his parents in collective homes. Later, he realized that he was born with a \"curse\", that makes him learn quickly and ask many questions. He excelled at the Science of Things and dreamed of becoming a Scholar. However, a Council of Vocations assigns all people to their Life Mandate, and he was assigned to be a Street Sweeper.\nEquality 7-2521 accepts his street sweeping assignment as penance for his \"Transgression of Preference\" in secretly desiring to be a Scholar. He works with Union 5-3992 and International 4-8818, who is Equality's only friend (which is another Transgression of Preference). He found an entrance to a tunnel in their assigned work area. Despite International's protests that any exploration unauthorized by a Council is forbidden, Equality entered the tunnel and found that it contains metal tracks. Equality realized that the tunnel is from the Unmentionable Times of the distant past. He began sneaking away from his community to use the tunnel as a laboratory for scientific experiments. He stole paper and is using it to write his journal. He is now 21 years old.\nWhile cleaning a road at the edge of the City, Equality meets Liberty 5-3000, a 17-year-old Peasant girl who works in the fields. He commits another transgression by thinking constantly of her, instead of waiting to be assigned a woman at the annual Time of Mating. She has dark eyes and golden hair, and he names her \"The Golden One\". When he speaks to her, he discovers that she also thinks of him. Later he reveals his secret name for her, and Liberty tells Equality she has named him \"The Unconquered\".\nContinuing his scientific work, Equality rediscovers electricity. In the ruins of the tunnel, he finds a glass box with wires in it, that gives off light when he passes electricity through it. He decides to take his discovery to the World Council of Scholars, thinking that such a great gift to mankind will outweigh his transgressions and lead to him being made a Scholar. However, one night he loses track of time in the underground tunnel and his absence from the Home of the Street Sweepers is noticed. He is whipped and held in the Palace of Corrective Detention. The night before the World Council of Scholars is set to meet, he easily escapes; there are no guards because no one has ever attempted escape before. The next day he presents his work to the World Council of Scholars. Horrified that he has done unauthorized research, they assail him as a \"wretch\" and a \"gutter cleaner\", saying he must be punished. They say his discovery must be destroyed, lest it disrupt the plans of the World Council and the Department of Candles. Equality seizes the box, cursing the council before fleeing into the Uncharted Forest that lies outside the City.\nIn the Uncharted Forest, Equality sees himself as damned for having left his fellow men, but he enjoys his freedom. No one will pursue him into this forbidden place. He only misses the Golden One. On his second day of living in the forest, the Golden One appears, having followed him into the forest. They live together in the forest and try to express their love for one another, but they lack the words to express love as individuals.\nThey find a house from the Unmentionable Times in the mountains, and decide to live in it. While reading books from the house's library, Equality discovers the word \"I\" and tells the Golden One about it. Having rediscovered individuality, they give themselves new names from the books: Equality becomes \"Prometheus\" and Liberty becomes \"Gaea\". Gaea is pregnant with Prometheus' child. Prometheus talks about the past, wondering how men could give up their individuality, and plans a future in which they will regain it.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"Anthem","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem_(novella)","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.62,"rating_count":95724,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/667.Anthem","found":true,"year":1938},"similar_books":["Ominous Parallels","The Criminal","One Lonely Night","Ayn Rand Answers: The Best of Her Q & A","The Passion of Ayn Rand","The Law","Fear","Anatomy of the State","Trustee from the Toolroom","A Modern Utopia","The Scarlet Plague","Logan's Run (Logan, #1)","Free Market Revolution: How Ayn Rand's Ideas Can End Big Government","Ayn Rand and the World She Made","Ape and Essence","My Years with Ayn Rand","Latter-day Liberty: A Gospel Approach to Government and Politics","Time Will Run Back: A Novel About the Rediscovery of Capitalism"],"description":"<b>Anthem</b> has long been hailed as one of <b>Ayn Rand</b>'s classic novels, and a clear predecessor to her later masterpieces, <b>The Fountainhead</b> and <b>Atlas Shrugged</b>.

The United States government assembles an expedition in New York City to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French marine biologist and narrator of the story, who happens to be in New York at the time, receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition which he accepts. Canadian whaler and master harpoonist Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful servant Conseil are also brought aboard.\nThe expedition departs Brooklyn aboard the United States Navy frigate Abraham Lincoln and travels south around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean. The ship finds the monster after a long search and then attacks the beast, which damages the ship's rudder. The three protagonists are then hurled into the water and grasp hold of the \"hide\" of the creature, which they find, to their surprise, to be a submarine very far ahead of its era. They are quickly captured and brought inside the vessel, where they meet its enigmatic creator and commander, Captain Nemo.\nThe rest of the story follows the adventures of the protagonists aboard the creature—the submarine, the Nautilus—which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas free from any land-based government. Captain Nemo's motivation is implied to be both a scientific thirst for knowledge and a desire for revenge upon (and self-imposed exile from) civilization. Nemo explains that his submarine is electrically powered and can perform advanced marine biology research; he also tells his new passengers that although he appreciates conversing with such an expert as Aronnax, maintaining the secrecy of his existence requires never letting them leave. Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the undersea adventures, but Ned Land can only think of escape.\nThey visited many places under the ocean, some of them could be found in real life while others were completely fictional. The travelers witness the real corals of the Red Sea, the wrecks of the battle of Vigo Bay, the Antarctic ice shelves, the Transatlantic telegraph cable and the fictional submerged land of Atlantis. The travelers also use diving suits to hunt sharks and other marine life with air-guns and have an underwater funeral for a crew member who died when an accident occurred under mysterious—and unknown to the reader—conditions inside the Nautilus. When the Nautilus returns to the Atlantic Ocean, a pack of \"poulpes\" (usually translated as a giant squid, although in French \"poulpe\" means \"octopus\") attacks the vessel and kills a crew member.\nThroughout the story Captain Nemo is suggested to have exiled himself from the world after an encounter with the forces that occupied his country that had devastating effects on his family. Not long after the incident of the poulpes, Nemo suddenly changes his behavior toward Aronnax, avoiding him. Aronnax no longer feels the same and begins to sympathize with Ned Land. Near the end of the book, the Nautilus is attacked by a warship of some nation that made Nemo suffer. Filled with hatred and revenge, Nemo ignores Aronnax's pleas for mercy. Nemo—nicknamed angel of hatred by Aronnax—destroys the ship, ramming it just below the waterline, sinking it into the bottom of the sea, much to Aronnax's horror, as he watches the ship plunge into the abyss. Nemo bows before the pictures of his wife and children and is plunged into deep depression after this encounter. For several days after this, the protagonists' situation changes. No one seems to be on board any longer and the Nautilus moves about randomly. Ned Land is even more depressed, Conseil fears for Ned's life, and Aronnax, horrified at what Nemo had done to the ship, can no longer stand the situation either. One evening, Ned Land announces an opportunity to escape. Although Aronnax wants to leave Nemo, whom he now holds in horror, he still wishes to see him for the last time. But he knows that Nemo would never let him escape, so he has to avoid meeting him. Before the escape, however, he sees him one last time (although secretly), and hears him say \"Almighty God! Enough! Enough!\". Aronnax immediately goes to his companions and they are ready to escape. But while they loosen the dinghy, they discover that the Nautilus has wandered into the Moskenstraumen, more commonly known as the \"Maelstrom\". They manage to escape and find refuge on a nearby island off the coast of Norway, but the fate of Nautilus is unknown.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.86,"rating_count":121268,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33507.Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea","found":true,"year":1869},"similar_books":["The Lost World & Other Stories","Sandokan: The Pirates of Malaysia","Two Years Before the Mast: A Sailor's Life at Sea","The Jungle Books","The Land That Time Forgot (Caspak, #1-3)","The Prince and the Pauper","The Coral Island","Ivanhoe","The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights","The Currents of Space (Galactic Empire #2)","The Food of the Gods","The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Other Stories","Night Flight","Tanglewood Tales: A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys"],"description":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (French: Vingt mille lieues sous les mers) is a classic science fiction novel by French writer Jules Verne, published in 1870.

He is sent to interview Professor George Edward Challenger, who has assaulted four or five other journalists, to determine if his claims about his trip to South America are true. After assaulting Malone, Challenger reveals his discovery of dinosaurs in South America. Having been ridiculed for years, he invites Malone on a trip to prove his story, along with Professor Summerlee and Lord John Roxton, an adventurer who knows the Amazon and several years prior to the events of the book helped end slavery by robber barons in South America. They reach the plateau with the aid of Indian guides, who are superstitiously scared of the area. One of these Indians, Gomez, is the brother of a man that Roxton killed the last time he was in South America. When the expedition manages to get onto the plateau, Gomez destroys their bridge, trapping them. Their \"devoted negro\" Zambo remains at the base, but is unable to prevent the rest of the Indians from leaving.\nDeciding to investigate the lost world, they are attacked by pterodactyls in a swamp, and Roxton finds some blue clay in which he takes a great interest. After exploring the plateau and having some adventures in which the expedition narrowly escapes being killed by dinosaurs, Challenger, Summerlee, and Roxton are captured by a race of ape-men. While in the ape-men's village, they find out that there is also a tribe of humans (calling themselves Accala) inhabiting the other side of the plateau, with whom the ape-men (called Doda by the Accala) are at war. Roxton manages to escape and team up with Malone to mount a rescue. They arrive just in time to prevent the execution of one of the professors and several other humans, including a young man who turns out to be a prince of sorts among the Accala. The rescued Accala then take the party to their tribe. With the help of the expediton's firepower, the Accala defeat the ape-men, taking control of the whole plateau.\nAfter witnessing the power of their guns, the human tribe does not want the expedition to leave, and tries to keep them on the plateau. Challenger first plans to fashion a series of balloons to carry the party off the plateau. However, with the help from the young prince of the Accala whom they had saved, the expedition finally discovers a tunnel that leads to the outside, where they meet up with Zambo and a large rescue party. Upon returning to England, they present their report, which include pictures and a newspaper report by Edward. However, many detractors continue to dismiss the expedition's account, much as they had Challenger's original story. Having anticipated this, Challenger shows them a live pterodactyl as proof, which then escapes and flies out into the Atlantic Ocean. When the four of them have dinner, Roxton shows them why he was so interested in the blue clay. It contains diamonds, about ï¿½200,000 worth, to be split between them.

A passing ship takes him aboard, and a man named Montgomery revives him. Prendick also meets a grotesque bestial native named M'ling, who appears to be Montgomery's manservant. The ship is transporting a number of animals which belong to Montgomery. As they approach the island, Montgomery's destination, the captain demands Prendick leave the ship with Montgomery. Montgomery explains that he will not be able to host Prendick on the island. Despite this, the captain leaves Prendick in a dinghy and sails away. Seeing that the captain has abandoned Prendick, Montgomery takes pity and rescues him. As ships rarely pass the island, Prendick will be housed in an outer room of an enclosed compound.\nThe island belongs to Dr. Moreau. Prendick remembers that he has heard of Moreau, formerly an eminent physiologist in London whose gruesome experiments in vivisection had been publicly exposed and has fled England as a result of his exposure.\nThe next day, Moreau begins working on a puma. Prendick gathers that Moreau is performing a painful experiment on the animal, and its anguished cries drive Prendick out into the jungle. While he wanders, he comes upon a group of people who seem human but have an unmistakable resemblance to swine. As he walks back to the enclosure, he suddenly realises he is being followed by a figure in the jungle. He panics and flees, and the figure gives chase. As his pursuer bears down on him, Prendick manages to stun him with a stone and observes the pursuer is a monstrous hybrid of animal and man. When Prendrick returns to the enclosure and questions Montgomery, Montgomery refuses to be open with him. After failing to get an explanation, Prendick finally gives in and takes a sleeping draught.\nPrendick awakes the next morning with the previous night's activities fresh in his mind. Seeing that the door to Moreau's operating room has been left unlocked, he walks in to find a humanoid form lying in bandages on the table before he is ejected by a shocked and angry Moreau. He believes that Moreau has been vivisecting humans and that he is the next test subject. He flees into the jungle where he meets an Ape-Man who takes him to a colony of similarly half-human/half-animal creatures. Their leader is a large grey thing named the Sayer of the Law who has him recite a strange litany called the Law that involves prohibitions against bestial behavior and praise for Moreau.\nSuddenly, Dr. Moreau bursts into the colony looking for Prendick, but Prendick escapes to the jungle. He makes for the ocean, where he plans to drown himself rather than allow Moreau to experiment on him. Moreau explains that the creatures called the Beast Folk were not formerly men, but rather animals. Prendick returns to the enclosure, where Moreau explains that he has been on the island for eleven years and has been striving to make a complete transformation of an animal to a human. He explains that while he is getting closer to perfection, his subjects have a habit of reverting to their animal form and behaviour. Moreau regards the pain he inflicts as insignificant and an unavoidable side effect in the name of his scientific experiments.\nOne day, Prendick and Montgomery encounter a half-eaten rabbit. Since eating flesh and tasting blood are strong prohibitions, Dr. Moreau calls an assembly of the Beast Folk and identifies the Leopard-Man (the same one that chased Prendick the first time he wandered into the jungle) as the transgressor. Knowing that he will be sent back to Dr. Moreau's compound for more painful sessions of vivisection, the Leopard-Man flees. Eventually, the group corners him in some undergrowth, but Prendick takes pity and shoots him to spare him from further suffering. Prendick also believes that although the Leopard-Man was seen breaking several laws, such as drinking water bent down like an animal, chasing men (Prendick), and running on all fours, the Leopard-Man was not solely responsible for the deaths of the rabbits. It was also the Hyena-Swine, the next most dangerous Beast Man on the island. Dr. Moreau is furious that Prendick killed the Leopard-Man but can do nothing about the situation.\nAs time passes, Prendick becomes inured to the grotesqueness of the Beast Folk. However one day, the half-finished puma woman rips free of her restraints and escapes from the lab. Dr. Moreau pursues her, but the two end up fighting each other which ends in a mutual kill. Montgomery breaks down and decides to share his alcohol with the Beast Folk. Prendick resolves to leave the island, but later hears a commotion outside in which Montgomery, his servant M'ling, and the Sayer of the Law die after a scuffle with the Beast Folk. At the same time, the compound burns down because Prendick has knocked over a lamp. With no chance of saving any of the provisions stored in the enclosure, Prendick realizes that during the night Montgomery has also destroyed the only boats on the island.\nPrendick lives with the Beast Folk on the island for months after the deaths of Moreau and Montgomery. As the time goes by, the Beast Folk increasingly revert to their original animal instincts, beginning to hunt the island's rabbits, returning to walking on all fours, and leaving their shared living areas for the wild. They cease to follow Prendick's instructions and eventually the Hyena-Swine kills his faithful companion, a Dog-Man created from a St. Bernard. Prendick then shoots the Hyena-Swine in self-defence with the help of the Sloth Creature. Luckily for Prendick ever since his efforts to build a raft have been unsuccessful, a boat that carries two corpses drifts onto the beach (perhaps the captain of the ship that picked Prendick up and a sailor). Prendick uses the boat to leave the island and is picked up three days later. But when he tells his story he is thought to be mad, so he feigns amnesia.\nBack in England, Prendick is no longer comfortable in the presence of humans who seem to him to be about to revert to the animal state. He leaves London and lives in near-solitude in the countryside, devoting himself to chemistry as well as astronomy in the studies of which he finds some peace.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The Island of Doctor Moreau","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Island_of_Doctor_Moreau","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.56,"rating_count":250,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/489892.The_Island_of_Doctor_Moreau","found":true,"year":1990},"similar_books":["Spacecraft: 2000-2100 AD","The early Asimov or, Eleven Years of Trying","Anak Mat Lela Gila","Sitora Harimau Jadian","The Stone God Awakens","The Essential Writings of Machiavelli","Yang Nakal-Nakal","The Lottery Ticket","One Lonely Night","Moby Dick","The Game","The Star Wars (The Star Wars, #2)","Kembara Sastera Nisah Haron : United Kingdom & Dublin","Animal Farm and Related Readings","Anak Bajang Menggiring Angin","The Definitive H.P.

While looking through the book, Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel find a coded note written in runic script along with the name of a 16th-century Icelandic alchemist, Arne Saknussemm. (This was a first indication of Verne's love for cryptography. Coded, cryptic or incomplete messages as a plot device would continue to appear in many of his works and in each case Verne would go a long way to explain not only the code used but also the mechanisms used to retrieve the original text.) Lidenbrock and Axel transliterate the runic characters into Latin letters, revealing a message written in a seemingly bizarre code. Lidenbrock attempts a decipherment, deducing the message to be a kind of transposition cipher; but his results are as meaningless as the original.\nProfessor Lidenbrock decides to lock everyone in the house and force himself and the others (Axel, and the maid, Martha) to go without food until he cracks the code. Axel discovers the answer when fanning himself with the deciphered text: Lidenbrock's decipherment was correct, and only needs to be read backwards to reveal sentences written in rough Latin. Axel decides to keep the secret hidden from Professor Lidenbrock, afraid of what the Professor might do with the knowledge, but after two days without food he cannot stand the hunger and reveals the secret to his uncle. Lidenbrock translates the note, which is revealed to be a medieval note written by the (fictional) Icelandic alchemist Arne Saknussemm, who claims to have discovered a passage to the centre of the Earth via Snï¿½fell in Iceland. In what Axel calls bad Latin, the deciphered message reads:\n\nIn Snefflls [sic] Iokulis kraterem kem delibat umbra Skartaris Iulii intra kalendas deskende, audas uiator, te [sic] terrestre kentrum attinges. Kod feki. Arne Saknussemm.\n\nIn slightly better Latin, with errors amended:\n\nIn Sneffels Jokulis craterem, quem delibat umbra Scartaris, Julii intra kalendas descende, audax viator, et terrestre centrum attinges; quod feci. Arne Saknussemm\n\nwhich, when translated into English, reads:\n\nDescend, bold traveller, into the crater of the jï¿½kull of Snï¿½fell, which the shadow of Scartaris touches (lit: tastes) before the Kalends of July, and you will attain the centre of the earth. I did it. Arne Saknussemm\n\nProfessor Lidenbrock is a man of astonishing impatience, and departs for Iceland immediately, taking his reluctant nephew with him. Axel, who, in comparison, is cowardly and anti-adventurous, repeatedly tries to reason with him, explaining his fears of descending into a volcano and putting forward various scientific theories as to why the journey is impossible, but Professor Lidenbrock repeatedly keeps himself blinded against Axel's point of view. After a rapid journey via Kiel and Copenhagen, they arrive in Reykjavï¿½k, where the two procure the services of Hans Bjelke (a Danish-speaking Icelander eiderdown hunter) as their guide, and travel overland to the base of the volcano.\nIn late June, they reach the volcano, which has three craters. According to Saknussemm's message, the passage to the center of the Earth is through the one crater that is touched by the shadow of a nearby mountain peak at noon. However, the text also states that this is only true during the last days of June. During the next few days, with July rapidly approaching, the weather is too cloudy for any shadows. Axel silently rejoices, hoping this will force his uncle – who has repeatedly tried to impart courage to him only to succeed in making him even more cowardly still – to give up the project and return home. Alas for Axel, however, on the second to last day, the sun comes out and the mountain peak shows the correct crater to take.\nAfter descending into the crater, the three travellers set off into the bowels of the Earth, encountering many strange phenomena and great dangers, including a chamber filled with firedamp, and steep-sided wells around the \"path\". After taking a wrong turn, they run out of water and Axel almost dies, but Hans taps into a neighbouring subterranean river. Lidenbrock and Axel name the resulting stream the \"Hansbach\" in his honour and the three are saved. At another point, Axel becomes separated from the others and is lost several miles from them. Luckily, a strange acoustic phenomenon allows him to communicate with them from some miles away, and they are soon reunited.\nAfter descending many miles, following the course of the Hansbach, they reach an unimaginably vast cavern. This underground world is lit by electrically charged gas at the ceiling, and is filled with a very deep subterranean ocean, surrounded by a rocky coastline covered in petrified trees and giant mushrooms. The travelers build a raft out of trees and set sail. The Professor names this sea the \"Lidenbrock Sea\" and the port as \"Port Grï¿½uben\", after the name of his goddaughter. While on the water, they see several prehistoric creatures such as a giant Ichthyosaurus, which fights with a Plesiosaurus and wins. After the battle between the monsters, the party comes across an island with a huge geyser, which Lidenbrock names \"Axel Island\".\nA lightning storm again threatens to destroy the raft and its passengers, but instead throws them onto the coastline. This part of the coast, Axel discovers, is alive with prehistoric plant and animal life forms, including giant insects and a herd of mastodons. On a beach covered with bones, Axel discovers an oversized human skull. Axel and Lidenbrock venture some way into the prehistoric forest, where Professor Lidenbrock points out, in a shaky voice, a prehistoric human, more than twelve feet in height, leaning against a tree and watching a herd of mastodons. Axel cannot be sure if he has really seen the man or not, and he and Professor Lidenbrock debate whether or not a proto-human civilization actually exists so far underground. The three wonder if the creature is a man-like ape, or an ape-like man. The sighting of the creature is considered the most alarming part of the story, and the explorers decide that it is better not to alert it to their presence as they fear it may be hostile.\nThe travellers continue to explore the coastline, and find a passageway marked by Saknussemm as the way ahead. However, it is blocked by what appears to be a recent cave-in and two of the three, Hans and the Professor, despair at being unable to hack their way through the granite wall. The adventurers plan to blast the rock with gun cotton and paddle out to sea to escape the blast. Upon executing the plan, however, they discover that behind the rockfall was a seemingly bottomless pit, not a passage to the center of the earth. The travellers are swept away as the sea rushes into the large open gap in the ground. After spending hours being swept along at lightning speeds by the water, the raft ends up inside a large volcanic chimney filling with water and magma. Terrified, the three are rushed upwards, through stifling heat, and are ejected onto the surface from a side-vent of a stratovolcano. When they regain consciousness, they discover that they have been ejected from Stromboli, a volcanic island located in southern Italy. They return to Hamburg to great acclaim – Professor Lidenbrock is hailed as one of the great scientists of history, Axel marries his sweetheart Grï¿½uben, and Hans eventually returns to his peaceful life in Iceland. The Professor has some regret that their journey was cut short.\nAt the very end of the book, Axel and Lidenbrock realize why their compass was behaving strangely after their journey on the raft. They realize that the needle was pointing the wrong way after being struck by an electric fireball which nearly destroyed the wooden raft.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.58,"rating_count":90433,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32829.Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth","found":true},"similar_books":["The First Men in the Moon","The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The D'Artagnan Romances, #3.1)","King Solomon's Mines (Allan Quatermain, #1)","The Lost World (Professor Challenger, #1)","Le tigri di Mompracem","The Lost Continent","Erewhon (Erewhon , #1)","Fantômas (Fantômas, #1)","A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","Kidnapped (David Balfour, #1)","The Joy of Life (Les Rougon-Macquart, #12)","The Collected Stories of Arthur C.

Early Soviet victories forced the North American government and production to flee to a Moon Base, leaving the majority of their troops behind. To counter the almost complete Soviet victory, U.N. technicians develop robots, nicknamed claws—the basic models are \"a churning sphere of blades and metal\" that ambush their unsuspecting victims \"spinning, creeping, shaking themselves up suddenly from the gray ash and darting toward… [any warm body].\" U.N. forces are protected from the claws by a special radiation-emitting wrist tab. Within six years, the sophisticated and independent claws have destroyed the Soviet forces, repairing and redesigning themselves in automated underground factories run without any human oversight.\nThe U.N. forces receive a message from the Soviets asking for a policy-level officer to go to them for a gravely urgent conference. The U.N. victory was costlier than they had expected. Major Joseph Hendricks is sent to negotiate with the Soviets. En route to the rendezvous, he meets a small boy named David who asks to accompany Hendricks. When they near the Soviet bunker, soldiers immediately kill the boy, revealing him to be an android. The claws' development program has evolved to develop sophisticated robots, indistinguishable from humans, designed to infiltrate and kill. The three Soviets met by Major Hendricks—soldiers Klaus, Rudi, and a young woman named Tasso—reveal that the entire Soviet army and command structure collapsed under the onslaught of the new robots - they are all that are left in the command center.\nFrom salvaged internal metal identification plates, two varieties are identified: I-V, a wounded soldier, and III-V, David. II-V—the \"second variety\"—remains unknown. The different models are produced independently of each other in different factories. The Soviets also reveal that the U.N. protective tabs are ineffective against the new robots. Hendricks attempts to transmit a warning to his H.Q. bunker, but is unable to do so.\nDuring the night, Klaus claims Rudi is the II-V and kills him, however Rudi's internal organs are human. The next morning, Hendricks and the two remaining Soviets return to the U.N. lines. When they reach the bunker, they discover it overrun: a crowd of David and Wounded Soldier robots attack, but Tasso destroys them with a very powerful hand grenade, stating that it was designed to destroy the robots. Hendricks and Tasso flee, leaving Klaus to the old-style claws. However, Klaus survives both the claws and the bomb blast only to be shot by Tasso, sending \"gears and wheels\" flying. Tasso tells Hendricks that Klaus must have been the II-V robot.\nHendricks, now suffering from a wounded arm and internal injuries, hopes to escape to the Moon Base. He and Tasso search for a hidden escape rocket, which is found to be a single-seat spacecraft. Hendricks attempts to leave, but Tasso convinces him to let her leave and send back help. In his injured state, he has no choice but to agree. Hendricks provides Tasso with the signal code needed to find the Moon Base.\nAlone and armed with Tasso's pistol, Hendricks returns to Klaus' remains and discovers from the parts that the robot was not a II-V, but a IV-V. A group of robots then attack Hendricks, including Davids, Wounded Soldiers, and several Tasso—the true II-V—models. Hendricks recognizes that he has doomed the Moon Base by sending a robot to them, and that he cannot withstand the onslaught of robots attacking him. Noticing the bombs carried by all the Tasso models, Hendricks' last ironic thought is that the robots are already producing weapons designed for killing each other.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"Second Variety","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Variety","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.96,"rating_count":935,"cover_art_url":"http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/32032/pg32032.cover.medium.jpg","goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8185014-second-variety","found":true,"year":1953},"similar_books":["Press Enter","Christmas in the Trenches","Youth","The Tunnel Under the World","The Order of Things: How Everything in the World Is Organized Into Hierarchies, Structures, and Pecking Orders","With Morning Comes Mistfall","Even the Queen: & Other Short Stories","The Elephant Vanishes: Free Short Story","The Traveler","The U.S. Constitution: And Fascinating Facts about It","Sailing to Byzantium","The Dreaming Jewels","The Snows of Kilimanjaro/The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber","The Children's Story","Doctor Who and the Talons of Weng-Chiang","The Big Trip Up Yonder by Kurt Vonnegut, Science Fiction, Literary","Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde: The Devoted Friend/The Nightingale and the Rose","Eight O'Clock in the Morning"],"loc_class":"PS: Language and Literatures: American and Canadian literature","gutenberg":{"url":"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32032","num":32032},"authors":[8],"language":"English","countries":[2],"release_date":"2010-04-17T00:00:00","author":8,"cover":"https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1476668036l/8185014.jpg","summary":"\"Second Variety\" is a science fiction short story by American writer Philip K.

During the American Civil War, five northern prisoners of war decide to escape, during the siege of Richmond, Virginia, by hijacking a balloon.\nThe escapees are Cyrus Smith, a railroad engineer in the Union army (named Cyrus Harding in Kingston's version); his ex-slave and loyal follower Neb (short for Nebuchadnezzar); Bonadventure Pencroff, a sailor (who is addressed only by his surname. In Kingston's translation, he is named Pencroft); his protï¿½gï¿½ and adopted son Harbert Brown (called Herbert in some translations); and the journalist Gedï¿½on Spilett (Gideon Spilett in English versions). The company is completed by Cyrus' dog \"Top\".[1]\nAfter flying in a great storm for several days, the group crash-lands on a cliff-bound, volcanic, unknown island, described as being located at 34ï¿½57′S 150ï¿½30′W, about 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi) east of New Zealand. They name it \"Lincoln Island\" in honor of their president, Abraham Lincoln. With the knowledge of the brilliant engineer Smith, the five are able to sustain themselves on the island, producing fire, pottery, bricks, nitroglycerin, iron, a simple electric telegraph, a home on a stony cliffside called \"Granite House\", and even a seaworthy ship, which they name the \"Bonadventure\" (in honor of Pencroff, the driving force behind its construction). They also manage to figure out their geographical location.\n\nDuring their stay on the island, the group endures bad weather, and domesticates an orangutan, Jupiter, abbreviated to Jup (or Joop, in Jordan Stump's translation). There is a mystery on the island in the form of an unseen deus ex machina, responsible for Cyrus' survival after falling from the balloon, the mysterious rescue of Top from a dugong, the appearance of a box of equipment (guns and ammunition, tools, etc.), and other seemingly inexplicable occurrences.\nThe group finds a message in a bottle directing them to rescue a castaway on nearby Tabor Island, who is none other than Tom Ayrton (from In Search of the Castaways). On the return voyage to Lincoln Island, they lose their way in a tempest but are guided back to their course by a mysterious fire beacon.\nAyrton's former companions arrive by chance on Lincoln Island, and try to make it into their lair. After some fighting with the protagonists, the pirate ship is mysteriously destroyed by an explosion. Six of the pirates survive and kidnap Ayrton. When the colonists go to look for him, the pirates shoot Harbert, seriously injuring him. Harbert survives, but suffers from his injury, narrowly cheating death. The colonists at first assume Ayrton to have been killed, but later they find evidence that he was not instantly killed, leaving his fate uncertain. When the colonists rashly attempt to return to Granite House before Harbert fully recovers, Harbert contracts malaria and is saved by a box of quinine sulphate, which mysteriously appears on the table in Granite House. After Harbert recovers, they attempt to rescue Ayrton and destroy the pirates. They discover Ayrton at the sheepfold, and the pirates dead, without any visible wounds.\nThe secret of the island is revealed when it is discovered to be Captain Nemo's hideout, and home port of the Nautilus. Having escaped the Maelstrom at the end of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, the Nautilus sailed the oceans of the world until all its crew except Nemo had died. Now an old man with a beard, Nemo returned the Nautilus to its secret port within Lincoln Island. Nemo had been the mysterious benefactor of the settlers, providing them with the box of equipment, sending the message revealing Ayrton, planting the mine that destroyed the pirate ship, and killing the pirates with an \"electric gun\". On his death bed Captain Nemo reveals his true identity as the lost Indian Prince Dakkar, son of a Raja of the then independent territory of Bundelkund and a nephew of the Indian hero Tippu-Sahib. After taking part in the failed Indian Rebellion of 1857, Prince Dakkar escaped to a deserted island with twenty of his compatriots and commenced the building of the Nautilus and adopted the new name of \"Captain Nemo\". Nemo also tells his life story to Cyrus Smith and his friends. Before he dies, he gives them a box of diamonds and pearls as a keepsake. Afterwards, he dies, crying \"God and my country!\" (\"Independence!\", in Verne's original manuscript). The Nautilus is scuttled and serves as Captain Nemo's tomb.[2]\nAfterward, the island's central volcano erupts, destroying the island. Jup the orangutan falls into a crack in the ground and dies. The colonists, forewarned of the eruption by Nemo, find themselves safe but stranded on the last remaining piece of the island above sea level. They are rescued by the ship Duncan, which had come to rescue Ayrton but were redirected by a message Nemo had previously left on Tabor Island. After they return to United States, they form a new colony in Iowa with Nemo's gift, and live happily ever after.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The Mysterious Island","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Island","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":4.08,"rating_count":26470,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32831.The_Mysterious_Island","found":true,"year":1874},"similar_books":["The Land That Time Forgot (Caspak, #1-3)","Всадник без головы","The Lost World & Other Stories","The Shape of Things to Come","The Stone Leopard","The Moon Pool","Le tigri di Mompracem","The Pathfinder (Leatherstocking Tales, #3)","The People of the Mist","Урфин Джюс и его деревянные солдаты (Волшебник изумрудного города, #2)","Lancelot","The Wonderful Adventures of Nils","After All These Years","Bad Twin","The Oath (Dismas Hardy, #8)","Twenty Years After (The D'Artagnan Romances, #2)","Приключения Чиполлино"],"description":"Five Union prisoners escape from the siege of Richmond in a balloon, are blown off course and crash on an uncharted island.

Strange events surround his birth and precocious development. Wilbur matures at an abnormal rate, reaching manhood within a decade. Locals shun him and his family, and animals fear and despise him due to his odor. All the while, his sorcerer grandfather indoctrinates him into certain dark rituals and the study of witchcraft. Various locals grow suspicious after Old Whateley buys more and more cattle, yet the number of his herd never increases, and the cattle in his field become mysteriously afflicted with severe open wounds.\nWilbur and his grandfather have sequestered an unseen presence at their farmhouse; this being is connected somehow to Yog-Sothoth. Year by year, this unseen entity grows to monstrous proportions, requiring the two men to make frequent modifications to their residence. People begin to notice a trend of cattle mysteriously disappearing. Wilbur's grandfather dies, and his mother disappears soon afterwards. The colossal entity eventually occupies the whole interior of the farmhouse.\nWilbur ventures to Miskatonic University in Arkham to procure their copy of the Necronomicon – Miskatonic's library is one of only a handful in the world to stock an original. The Necronomicon has spells that Wilbur can use to summon the Old Ones, but his family's copy is damaged and lacks the page he needs to open the \"door.\" When the librarian, Dr. Henry Armitage, refuses to release the university's copy to him (and, by sending warnings to other libraries, thwarts Wilbur's efforts to consult their copies), Wilbur breaks into the library at night to steal it. A guard dog, maddened by Wilbur's alien body odor, attacks and kills him with unusual ferocity. When Dr. Armitage and two other professors, Warren Rice and Francis Morgan, arrive on the scene, they see Wilbur's semi-human corpse before it melts completely, leaving no evidence.\nWith Wilbur dead, no one attends to the mysterious presence growing in the Whateley farmhouse. Early one morning, the farmhouse explodes and the thing, an invisible monster, rampages across Dunwich, cutting a path through fields, trees, and ravines, and leaving huge \"prints\" the size of tree trunks. The monster eventually makes forays into inhabited areas. The invisible creature terrorizes Dunwich for several days, killing two families and several policemen, until Armitage, Rice, and Morgan arrive with the knowledge and weapons needed to kill it. The use of a magic powder renders it visible just long enough to send one of the crew into shock. The barn-sized monster screams for help - in English - just before the spell destroys it, leaving a huge burned area. In the end, its nature is revealed: it is Wilbur's twin brother, though it \"looked more like the father than Wilbur did.\"","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The Dunwich Horror","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dunwich_Horror","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":4.31,"rating_count":6765,"cover_art_url":"http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/50133/pg50133.cover.medium.jpg","goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63213.The_Dunwich_Horror_and_Others","found":true,"year":1945},"similar_books":["A Rendezvous in Averoigne","Shadows over Innsmouth","The Yellow Sign & Other Stories","Cold Print","Cthulhu: The Mythos and Kindred Horrors","Disciples of Cthulhu","Dark Gods","Noctuary","Fruiting Bodies and Other Fungi","H.P.

Dr. Whipple has made extensive records tracking the mysterious, yet apparently, coincidental sickness and death of many who have lived in the house for over one hundred years. They are also puzzled by the strange weeds growing in the yard, as well as the unexplained foul smell, and whitish phosphorescent fungi growing in the cellar.\n\nAfter the protagonist discovers a strange, yellowish vapour in the basement, which seems to be coupled with a moldy outline of a huddled human form on the floor, he and his uncle decide to spend the night in the house, investigating the possibility of some supernatural force. They set up both cots and chairs in the cellar, arm themselves with military flamethrowers, and outfit a modified Crookes tube in the hopes of destroying any supernatural presence they might find.\nWhen Dr. Whipple naps, while his nephew keeps watch, he begins tossing and turning, and finally starts babbling in French, until he suddenly awakes. He tells the protagonist he had strange visions of lying in an open pit, inside a house with constantly shifting features, while faces stared down at him. Many of the faces were those of the Harris family, whose members died in the house.\nWhen the protagonist sleeps, he is awakened by a horrific scream. He sees a revolting yellowish \"corpse-light\" bubbling up from the floor, which stares at him with many eyes before vanishing in a wisp through the chimney. He finds his uncle transformed into a monster with \"blackened, decaying features\" and dripping claws. He turns on the Crookes tube, but seeing that it has no effect, escapes the house through the cellar door as his uncle's body dissolves, transforming into a multitude of faces of those who died in the house as it melts. The protagonist returns the next day to find his equipment intact, but no body.\nThe protagonist hatches a plan. He orders a military gas mask, digging tools, and six carboys of sulfuric acid to be delivered to the cellar door of the shunned house. He digs into the earthen floor of the cellar, turning up fungous yellow ooze, and arranges the barrels of acid around the hole in the belief that he will happen upon some kind of monstrous creature. Eventually, he uncovers a soft, blue-white, translucent tube, bent in half and two feet in diameter at its widest point. He frantically climbs out of the neck-deep hole, and dumps in four barrels of acid, realizing that he had found the elbow of a gigantic monster.

The narrator is a square named A Square, a member of the caste of gentlemen and professionals, who guides the readers through some of the implications of life in two dimensions. The first half of the story goes through the practicalities of existing in a two-dimensional universe as well as a history leading up to the year 1999 on the eve of the 3rd Millennium.\nOn New Year's Eve, the Square dreams about a visit to a one-dimensional world (Lineland) inhabited by \"lustrous points\", in which he attempts to convince the realm's monarch of a second dimension; but is unable to do so. In the end, the monarch of Lineland tries to kill A Square rather than tolerate his nonsense any further.\nFollowing this vision, he is himself visited by a three-dimensional sphere named A Sphere, which he cannot comprehend until he sees Spaceland (a tridimensional world) for himself. This Sphere visits Flatland at the turn of each millennium to introduce a new apostle to the idea of a third dimension in the hopes of eventually educating the population of Flatland. From the safety of Spaceland, they are able to observe the leaders of Flatland secretly acknowledging the existence of the sphere and prescribing the silencing of anyone found preaching the truth of Spaceland and the third dimension. After this proclamation is made, many witnesses are massacred or imprisoned (according to caste), including A Square's brother, B.\nAfter the Square's mind is opened to new dimensions, he tries to convince the Sphere of the theoretical possibility of the existence of a fourth (and fifth, and sixth ...) spatial dimension; but the Sphere returns his student to Flatland in disgrace.\nThe Square then has a dream in which the Sphere visits him again, this time to introduce him to Pointland, whereof the point (sole inhabitant, monarch, and universe in one) perceives any communication as a thought originating in his own mind (cf. Solipsism):\n\n\"You see,\" said my Teacher, \"how little your words have done. So far as the Monarch understands them at all, he accepts them as his own – for he cannot conceive of any other except himself – and plumes himself upon the variety of Its Thought as an instance of creative Power. Let us leave this God of Pointland to the ignorant fruition of his omnipresence and omniscience: nothing that you or I can do can rescue him from his self-satisfaction.\"\n\nThe Square recognizes the identity of the ignorance of the monarchs of Pointland and Lineland with his own (and the Sphere's) previous ignorance of the existence of higher dimensions. Once returned to Flatland, the Square cannot convince anyone of Spaceland's existence, especially after official decrees are announced that anyone preaching the existence of three dimensions will be imprisoned (or executed, depending on caste). Eventually the Square himself is imprisoned for just this reason, with only occasional contact with his brother who is imprisoned in the same facility. He does not manage to convince his brother, even after all they have both seen. Seven years after being imprisoned, A Square writes out the book Flatland in the form of a memoir, hoping to keep it as posterity for a future generation that can see beyond their two-dimensional existence.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated)","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":0,"rating_count":0,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35559483-flatland-a-romance-of-many-dimensions","found":true,"year":-1},"similar_books":[],"loc_class":"QA: Science: Mathematics","gutenberg":{"url":"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201","num":201},"authors":[10],"language":"English","countries":[1],"release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00","author":10,"cover":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","summary":"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions is a satirical novella by the English schoolmaster Edwin Abbott Abbott, first published in 1884 by Seeley & Co. of London.\nWritten pseudonymously by \"A Square\", the book used the fictional two-dimensional world of Flatland to comment on the hierarchy of Victorian culture, but the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions.\nSeveral films have been made from the story, including the feature film Flatland (2007).

On the third day of their stay, they stumble upon the ruins of a strangely shaped house on a large lake. They discover the mouldering journal of the Recluse, an unidentified man who recorded his last days in the house before its destruction.\nThe Recluse begins his journal with descriptions of how he acquired the house, along with his daily life with his sister and his faithful dog, Pepper. He started the diary to record the strange experiences and horrors occurring in and around the house. The Recluse relates a vision in which he travels to a remote and vast arena, \"the Plain of Silence\", surrounded by mountains with representations of mythological beast-gods, demons, and other \"bestial horrors\" on their slopes. In the center of the plain stands a house almost identical to his own, save that the house in the arena is much larger and appears to be made of a green jade-like substance. Along the way, he sees a huge, menacing humanoid with swine-like features.\nShortly after his vision of the \"arena,\" he is attacked by humanoid pig-like creatures that he names \"the swine-things\", which appear to come from the depths of a great chasm under the house. The struggle with these creatures lasts for several nights of increasing ferocity, but the man kills several of the creatures and drives them off. As he searches for the origin of the swine-things, the man finds a pit beyond the gardens where a river descends into the earth. There he finds a tunnel leading to the great chasm. A rock slide dams the water in the pit. The man is trapped, but Pepper rescues him. The house transports the Recluse to an unknown place called \"the Sea of Sleep\" where he briefly reunites with his lost love.\nTonnison and Berreggnog must stop reading there as the house collapse has destroyed much of the journal. Except for an enigmatic fragment, the book becomes unreadable between the passage describing \"the Sea of Sleep\" and a later entry titled \"The noise in the night\". They realise that the water from the dammed pit has overflowed to create the lake. They suppose that the destroyed section of the journal may have explained other mysteries about the house.\nAs the Recluse's story continues, he notices that the passage of day and night has increased in speed, eventually blurring into a never-ending twilight. As he watches, his surroundings decay and collapse to dust. The dead world slowly grinds to a halt and the sun goes out after several million millennia. Once the world ends, the man floats through space, seeing angelic, human, and demonic forms passing before his eyes. Later, he finds himself back in his own study on Earth, with everything apparently returned to normality, with one exception: Pepper is dead.\nThe malicious swine-beast from his earlier journeys to the \"arena\" has followed him back to his own dimension. The creature infects the man's new dog with a luminous fungal disease. Although the man shoots the suffering animal, he also contracts the disease. The manuscript ends with the man, by then partly covered by the fungal growth, locked (from the outside only) in his study as the creature comes through a trap door in the basement from the chasm under the house. As he ponders suicide to end his suffering, the creature tries to open the study door and the diary abruptly ends.\nTonnison and Berreggnog search for information about the man and his circumstances. They learn that the house was long believed to be evil before the unsociable old man and his elderly sister acquired it. Monthly supplies were brought in by a man who would say nothing about the Recluse. After several years, the man returned early one day from his delivery trip and said that the house had mysteriously fallen into the chasm. The two travellers leave Kraighten and never return. The novel ends with a five-verse poem titled \"Grief\", found behind the fly-leaf of the diary.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The House on the Borderland","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_on_the_Borderland","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.67,"rating_count":2697,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220937.The_House_on_the_Borderland","found":true,"year":1908},"similar_books":["The Complete John Silence Stories (Dover Horror Classics)","The Three Impostors and Other Stories","More Ghost Stories of an Antiquary","The Witch Of Prague & Other Stories","In a Lonely Place","Can Such Things Be?","The Dark Country","Wonder Tales: The Book of Wonder and Tales of Wonder","The Door to Saturn","Grimscribe: His Lives and Works","The Yellow Sign & Other Stories","The Face That Must Die"],"description":"A manuscript is found: filled with small, precise writing and smelling of pit-water, it tells the story of an old recluse and his strange home - and its even stranger, jade-green double, seen by the recluse on an otherworldly plain where gigantic gods and monsters roam.<br /><br />Soon his more earthly home is no less terrible than his bizarre vision, as swine-like creatures boil from a cavern beneath the ground and besiege it.

The language and style used are intended to resemble that of the 17th century, though the prose has features characteristic of no period whatsoever: the almost-complete lack of dialogue and proper names, for example. Critic Ian Bell has suggested that John Milton's epic poem \"Paradise Lost\" (1667) is probably a partial literary inspiration for Hodgson's novel, especially due to the hellish visions of sombre intensity which mark both works, and other similarities including the use of massive structures (the Temple of Pandemonium in Milton and the Last Redoubt in The Night Land).\nOnce into the book, the 17th century framing is mostly inconsequential. Instead, the story focuses on the future. The Sun has gone out and the Earth is lit only by the glow of residual vulcanism. The last few millions of the human race are gathered together in a gigantic metal pyramid, nearly eight miles high – the Last Redoubt, under siege from unknown forces and Powers outside in the dark. These are held back by a shield known as the \"air clog\", powered from a subterranean energy source called the \"Earth Current\". For millennia, vast living shapes—the Watchers—have waited in the darkness near the pyramid. It is thought they are waiting for the inevitable time when the Circle's power finally weakens and dies. Other living things have been seen in the darkness beyond, some of unknown origins, and others that may once have been human.\nTo leave the protection of the Circle means almost certain death, or worse an ultimate destruction of the soul. As the story commences, the narrator establishes mind contact with an inhabitant of another, forgotten Lesser Redoubt. First one expedition sets off to succour the inhabitants of the Lesser Redoubt, whose own Earth Current has been exhausted, only to meet with disaster. After that, the narrator sets off alone into the darkness to find the girl he has made contact with, knowing now that she is the reincarnation of his past love.\nAt the conclusion of the adventure, the narrative does not return to the framework story, instead ending with the happy homecoming of the couple and his inauguration into the ranks of their most honoured heroes.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The Night Land","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Land","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.65,"rating_count":624,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/970602.The_Night_Land","found":true,"year":1912},"similar_books":["Zothique","Dwellers in the Mirage","The Three Impostors and Other Stories","The Unforsaken Hiero  (Hiero, #2)","Awake in the Night Land","The Evil Guest","The Mask of Cthulhu","The Phantom Ship","The Blue Star","Tales Of The Uncanny And Supernatural","The Gods of Pegana","Our Lady Of Darkness","When Worlds Collide (When Worlds Collide, #1)"],"description":"\"---this fantasy of a night-black, dead planet, with the remains of the human race concentrated in a stupendously vast metal pyramid &amp; besieged by monstrous, hybrid &amp; altogether unknown forces of darkness, is something that no reader can ever forget\" (H.

P. Lovecraft's essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\" describes the novel as \"one of the most potent pieces of macabre imagination ever written\". Clark Ashton Smith wrote of it that \"In all literature, there are few works so sheerly remarkable, so purely creative, as The Night Land. Whatever faults this book may possess, however inordinate its length may seem, it impresses the reader as being the ultimate saga of a perishing cosmos, the last epic of a world beleaguered by eternal night and by the unvisageable spawn of darkness. Only a great poet could have conceived and written this story; and it is perhaps not illegitimate to wonder how much of actual prophecy may have been mingled with the poesy.\"\nWhen the book was written, the nature of the energy source that powers stars was not known: Lord Kelvin had published calculations based on the hypothesis that the energy came from the gravitational collapse of the gas cloud that had formed the sun and found that this mechanism gave the Sun a lifetime of only a few tens of million of years. Starting from this premise, Hodgson wrote a novel describing a time, millions of years in the future, when the Sun has gone dark.","content_cleaned":true,"classes":["to-read","horror","fantasy","science-fiction","fiction","currently-reading","sci-fi","classics","kindle","favorites","weird-fiction","owned","post-apocalyptic","ebook","ebooks","sf","dying-earth","dystopia","apocalyptic","scifi","abandoned","classic","fantasï¿½a","to-buy","adventure","romance","english","novels","terror","ciencia-ficciï¿½n","on-kindle","dystopian","free","earth","novel","weird","sci-fi-fantasy","want-to-read","maybe","project-gutenberg","novela","science-fiction-fantasy","d-d","fiction-to-read","surrealism","appendix-e","audiobooks","numenera","fantasy-sci-fi","reviewed","e-book","e-books","unrated","gave-up-on","classic-horror","my-library","wish-list","to-read-ebook","i-own-it","far-future","not-read","post-apocalypse","time-travel","books-i-own","library","story","framing","dying","uncanny","science","gothic","scifi-fantasy","junk","appendix-n-appendix-e","fil-2017","no-kindle-books","own-digital","xlong-over-400","radium-age-sff","zz1911-1915","historicity","aa-europelit","aa-englandlit","d-d-inspiration","unheimlich","the-back-log","100x100-romans-fantastiques","filosofia","psychedelic-books-for-the-mind","bookshelf-1","on-calibre-to-read","my-kindle-collection","distopian","unread-ibooks","dark-horror","best-of-the-decades","unread-but-owned-books","libros-autoconclusivos","shelfari-migration","horror-to-read"],"content_available":true,"n_authors":1},{"content_name":"64.txt.utf-8","isbn":"0345324390","original_title":"The Gods of Mars","year":1913,"author_name":"Edgar Rice Burroughs","images_urls":[],"language_code":"eng","images":["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Cutta_fight.jpg","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Gods_of_Mars-1918.jpg"],"id":21,"category":"Text","plot":"After John Carter's arrival, a boat of Green Martians on the River Iss are ambushed by the previously unknown Plant Men. The lone survivor is his friend Tars Tarkas, the Jeddak of Thark, who has taken the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor to find Carter. Having saved their own lives, Carter and Tars Tarkas discover that the Therns, a white-skinned race of self-proclaimed gods, have for eons deceived the Barsoomians elsewhere by disseminating that the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor is a journey to paradise. Most arrivals are killed by the beasts of Valley, and the survivors enslaved or eaten by Therns.\nCarter and Tars Tarkas rescue Thuvia, a slave girl, and attempt to escape, capitalizing on the confusion caused by an attack by the Black Pirates of Barsoom upon the Therns. During the attack, Tars Tarkas and Thuvia hijack a Black Pirate flier, while Carter fights his way aboard another, killing all but one of the Pirates, and rescuing a captive Thern princess. From the captured Pirate Xodar, Carter learns that the Black Pirates, called the \"First Born\", also think of themselves as gods, and accordingly prey upon the Therns; and additionally identifies the captive Thern as Phaidor, daughter of the \"Holy Hekkador\" (high priest) of the Therns. When their flier is recaptured by the First Born and taken to their underground realm of Omean, Carter is taken before Issus, the self-proclaimed goddess of Barsoom, who dictates the Therns through secret communications which they mistake for divine revelation.\nIssus takes Phaidor as a handmaiden for one Martian year; whereas Carter is imprisoned, with Xodar as his slave as punishment for being defeated by Carter. Thereafter Carter treats him with honor, and thus gains his friendship. In prison, they encounter a young man later identified as Carter's son Carthoris, with whom Carter is taken to a series of games wherein the previous year's handmaidens are killed and later eaten by Issus and her nobles. Carter leads a revolt of the prisoners, killing many of the First Born; and upon the suppression of their revolt, he and Carthoris escape via underground tunnels, and give themselves to guards unacquainted with the revolt to be returned to their prison. Upon hearing of the revolt, Xodar rejects Issus’ divinity and joins the others in escape. Upon later abandoning their aircraft, they encounter Thuvia, who describes the capture of Tars Tarkas by the green warriors of Warhoon (a clan rival to his own). Carter goes to rescue Tars Tarkas, but is discovered by his enemies. After a chase, Thuvia is sent on alone, mounted, while the men attempt a stand against the Warhoons. They are rescued by the Heliumetic navy but do not find Thuvia. Commanding one of the warships is Carter’s friend Kantos Kan but the fleet is commanded by Zat Arras, a Jed (chieftain) of the hostile client state of Zodanga, and Carter is suspected of returning from the Valley of Dor, which is punishable by death. Tardos Mors, the Jeddak of Helium, and Mors Kajak, the Jed of Hastor (the grandfather and father, respectively, of Dejah Thoris, and thus Carter’s in-laws) are absent from Helium, having led fleets in search of Carthoris. Later, Carter discovers that Dejah Thoris may have taken the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor to find him.\nUpon returning to Helium, Carter is tried for heresy by the Zodangans; but the people of Helium do not tolerate this, and Carter is held prisoner for 365 days until his son frees him. Thereafter he goes to rescue Dejah Thoris but is kidnapped by the Zodangans. Carter refuses Zat Arras’ offer of freedom in exchange for endorsing Zat Arras as Jeddak of Helium, and is imprisoned. After half a (Barsoomian) year, Carter escapes, and embarks to Omean, with secretly raised troop levies, ships, and soldiers lent by Tars Tarkas. Near Omean Carter is challenged first by the Therns; secondly by Zat Arras; and lastly by the First Born, whereupon Carter causes the Therns and First Born to fight one another, and the Heliumetic crews of the Zodangan fleet mutiny in support of Carter. Thereafter the Heliumites and Tharks defeat the First Born, and Issus herself is killed. But Dejah Thoris, Thuvia, and Phaidor are imprisoned in the Temple of the Sun, each of whose rooms opens only once per year, by Issus, specifically to spite Carter, as Issus was aware that all three were in love with him. Carter and his men scramble to find the keys to their cell in time, but are unsuccessful. Immediately before their room closes, Phaidor attempts to kill Dejah Thoris, and her success or failure are left unknown. The story is thence continued in the third book of Burroughs’ Martian series, The Warlord of Mars.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The Gods of Mars","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gods_of_Mars","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.86,"rating_count":10869,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/841973.The_Gods_of_Mars","found":true,"year":1913},"similar_books":["John Carter of Mars: Warlord of Mars","The Conquering Sword of Conan (Conan the Cimmerian, #3)","Transit to Scorpio (Dray Prescot, #1) (Delian Cycle, #1)","A Private Cosmos (World of Tiers #3)","The Skylark of Space (Skylark #1)","The Time Traders (Time Traders/ Ross Murdock, #1)","Lord Of The Spiders Or Blades Of Mars (Michael Kane, Vol. 2)","In the Days of the Comet","The Return of Nathan Brazil (Saga of the Well World, #4)","Time for the Stars","Spacecraft: 2000-2100 AD","Deathworld Trilogy","Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan: The Land That Time Forgot","Jane Carver of Waar (Jane Carver, #1)"],"description":"1886.

But an old and corrupt Centaurian Empire is holding Terra down, as it encircles the Terran system and will not let the humans grow out of their current empire. For this reason Terra is at war with Proxima Centauri and is trying to find a way of breaking free from the Centaurian's hold upon them.\nIn the war that results, Terra is continually coming up with new weapons to try and break the Centaurian defenses, but Proxima Centauri is also continually updating its defenses. Using spies and other such tactics, both parties find out about each other's advances, and no actual fighting ever occurs because both sides are too busy trying to beat each other with new technological developments. Terra even calculates their chances to win a war versus Centauri and updates these calculations with each new development, making their decision about a war rely on this calculation. Eventually Terra comes up with a concept for a bomb, called Icarus, that Proxima can not defend against because it travels at faster than light speeds, making use of the buildup of mass at near light speeds as a destructive agent when it slows down to below light speed. Then the odds start to side with Terra, and Terra prepares to fight with this new-found technology. There are two problems; the first is that Icarus does not yet work, which prevents Terra from using it against Proxima Centauri, and the second is that the existence of Cole on Terra is an \"unknown variable\" that confuses the war win probability computer. Hence, the book is titled \"The Variable Man\".\nThis is where Thomas Cole, known as The Variable Man, comes in. Cole is a man from the past, from 1913, the time just before the First World War. He is brought into the present (or future depending on perspective) as an accident via a Time Bubble that was used for research about the past. He escapes from the authority in the future and spends a lot of time running from them afterwards. It is, however, discovered that this man has a certain genius to fix things and make things work. This is because he comes out of a period of time when humans had a natural genius and an ability to invent things and to solve problems. It is at this point that the man working on the FTL (Faster Than Light) bomb realizes that The Variable Man is the only person who can make Icarus work. As a result, the engineer working on Icarus convinces The Variable Man to help them out. Icarus does eventually work, although not in the way that anyone may have wanted. Instead of emerging from FTL speed in the middle of Centarus (the sun around which the Centaurian Empire is built) and blowing it, and the surrounding Centaurian system, out of existence, it turns out that Cole transformed (or fixed) Icarus into a working hyperdrive. However the order for Terra to launch a full-scale attack against the Centaurian Empire (under the assumption that the majority of the enemy ships and planets would have been destroyed in the Icarus explosion) had already been given. The forces of Terra suffered a terrible defeat, losing many of their ships, yet due to the Variable Man having successfully wired Icarus it was now possible for Terra to travel beyond the Centaurian Empire's perimeter. Terra was no longer blocked into their tiny system, and there was no further need for war.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The Variable Man","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Variable_Man","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.76,"rating_count":995,"cover_art_url":"http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/32154/pg32154.cover.medium.jpg","goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8734881-the-variable-man","found":true,"year":1953},"similar_books":["Youth","The Pirates of Ersatz","Forbidden the Stars (The Interstellar Age, #1)","Empire","After the Battle on Starship Hill: Prologue to The Children of the Sky","Christmas in the Trenches","The Dreaming Jewels","Even the Queen: & Other Short Stories","Press Enter","Citizen In Space","Tales of Space and Time","Apex Cypher (Techxorcist #0)","The Constitution of the United States with the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation","White Collar Christmas","The U.S. Constitution: And Fascinating Facts about It","The Misplaced Battleship","The Unveiling","The Best and the Brightest"],"description":"Predictability has come a long way.

In the meantime, Carter's friend Xodar has become the new Jeddak (chief or king) of the black Martian First Born, and those white Martian therns who reject the old religion likewise gain a new unnamed leader, but there are still some who wish to keep the old discredited religion going, including the therns' erstwhile leader, the Holy Hekkador Matai Shang. John Carter discovers that a First Born named Thurid knows the secret of the Temple of the Sun and he and Matai Shang want to rescue the Holy Thern's daughter Phaidor, who has been imprisoned with Dejah Thoris and another Barsoomian princess, Thuvia of Ptarth, in the Temple jail for several hundred days.\nThurid, to spite Carter, gets Matai Shang to also take Dejah Thoris and Thuvia along with them. Carter follows them in the hope of liberating his beloved wife.\nHis antagonists flee to the north, taking the three women along. (This resolves the cliffhanger from the previous book, in which Phaidor attempts to stab Dejah Thoris; apparently, Thuvia successfully disarmed Phaidor, and nobody was killed.) In the equatorial Land of Kaol, on the opposite side of the planet from Helium, their jeddak Kulan Tith has not yet abandoned the old religion, and accepted Matai Shang's request for safe haven. Carter rescues the jeddak's forces from an ambush, and is admitted to Kaol, as a neighboring jeddak and good friend of his comes for a visit with his huge retinue. Matai Shang and Thurid unmask Carter's disguise and denounce his heresies, but the visiting jeddak, Thuvan Dihn of Ptarth, who is Thuvia's father, hotly defends Carter. Kulan Tith orders Matai Shang to deliver Dejah Thoris and Thuvia, but instead, he and Thurid take the women and flee to the north. After this treachery against his friend, Kulan Tith finally abjures the old religion and offers whatever help he can to Carter and Thuvan Dihn, but little can be done at this point.\nThereafter John Carter follows them untiringly into the north polar regions where he discovers more fantastic creatures and the nearly forgotten Yellow Martians, who live on the north polar cap behind a ring-shaped ice barrier. After traversing through the Carrion Caves which cross the barrier, Carter and Thuvan Dihn encounter Talu, the rebellious nephew of the tyrant Salensus Oll, who rules the yellow Martians' realm of Okar from the city of Kadabra. Talu provides Carter and Thuvan Dihn with advice and assistance, including disguising the two as yellow Martians. They infiltrate Salensus Oll's court, but Thurid and Matai Shang discover Carter, and have him thrown into a pit. Carter escapes thanks to help from one of Talu's moles in the court. Carter rescues Tardos Mors and Mors Kajak of Helium, triggering a rebellion among the Heliumite prisoners, which turns into a full-fledged invasion after Carter deactivates the yellow Martians' magnetic tower that wrecks invading fleets so Helium's fleet can land safely, carrying a volunteer force of Green Martians headed by Tars Tarkas as well. After a tremendous battle, Salensus Oll is killed, and Thurid and Matai Shang are forced to flee. In a dramatic scene, Carter follows them onto an airship, over a chasm. First, Matai Shang is tossed overboard by Thurid and killed, then after Thurid attempts to do the same to Carter, he is knifed and thrown overboard by Phaidor. Lastly, Phaidor announces to Carter that she repents of her jealousy, and recognizes the love that Carter and Dejah Thoris have for each other, and throws herself overboard in reparation for her sins before Carter can stop her.\nAfterwards, in a continuation of Zat Arrras' trial, Carter is instead proclaimed \"Warlord of Barsoom\" by his allies. This book is the last to feature Tars Tarkas, John Carter's ally, in any major role; indeed, the green Barsoomians of whom Tars Tarkas is an oligarch disappear altogether from most of the later novels.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"Warlord of Mars","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warlord_of_Mars","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.86,"rating_count":8247,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40379.The_Warlord_of_Mars","found":true,"year":1914},"similar_books":["John Carter of Mars: Warlord of Mars","Iceworld","Lord Of The Spiders Or Blades Of Mars (Michael Kane, Vol. 2)","A Private Cosmos (World of Tiers #3)","The Stars are Also Fire (Harvest of Stars, #2)","Under the Moons of Mars: New Adventures on Barsoom","Conan the Warrior (Book 7)","Space Viking","Galactic Patrol (Lensman, #3)","The Voyage of the Space Beagle","Between Planets","Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan: The Land That Time Forgot","Northwest Smith"],"description":"John Carter risks everything to rescue his wife, Princess Dejah Thoris, from the clutches of his evil adversaries, but he is always just one step behind!

Gramps' grandson Louis, his wife Emerald, and 20 other descendants are crowded into the space, perpetually jockeying for Gramps' favor. Gramps gets the best food and the only private bedroom, and controls everyone's life by constantly revising his will to disinherit anyone who earns his displeasure.\nAn offhand remark by Lou prompts Gramps to disinherit him and exile Lou and Em to the worst sleeping space in the apartment, near the bathroom. Lou then catches his great-grandnephew, newly wed Mortimer, diluting Gramps' anti-gerasone in the bathroom. Fearing Gramps' reaction to such a scheme, Lou tries to empty the bottle and refill it with the full-strength medicine, but accidentally breaks the bottle and is caught by Gramps, who only tells him to clean up the mess. The next morning, the family finds Gramps' bed empty and a note informing them that he is gone; the note also contains a revised will that bequeaths his entire estate to be held in common by his descendants, with no stipulations as to who receives what property.\nA riot breaks out as the family members start fighting over who gets the bedroom, leading to everyone being arrested and jailed at the police station. Lou and Em find the cells to be comfortable and spacious compared to the apartment, and hope that they will be sentenced to prison so they can keep these living arrangements. Meanwhile, Gramps has returned to the now-empty apartment, having watched the events unfold from a tavern across the plaza. He has hired the best lawyer in town in order to get everyone convicted, so that he can have the apartment to himself and they can enjoy the relative comfort of jail for a while. Gramps sees a television commercial for a new product called Super-anti-gerasone, which can reverse the aging process instead of just halting it, and starts thinking about being able to enjoy life again.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The Big Trip Up Yonder","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow_and_Tomorrow_and_Tomorrow_(short_story)","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.91,"rating_count":155,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8136616-the-big-trip-up-yonder-2br02b","found":true,"year":1962},"similar_books":["A Prefect's Uncle (School Stories, #2)","Brewster's Millions","Like Warm Sun on Nekkid Bottoms","Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","The Duchess of Padua","Flowers for Elvis","Mr. Spaceship","Ten Billion Days and One Hundred Billion Nights","The Scent of Magic (Doomspell, #2)","Moonlight in Odessa","Siesta Lane: A Year Unplugged, or, The Good Intentions of Ten People, Two Cats, One Old Dog, Eight Acres, One Telephone, Three Cars, and Twenty Miles to the Nearest Town","Two Years Before the Mast and Twenty-Four Years After (Harvard Classics, #23)","Learning to Fly","The Outlaw Varjak Paw","O psie, ktï¿½ry jeździł koleją","The Brenner Assignment: The Untold Story of the Most Daring Spy Mission of World War II","A Pluralistic Universe","Fireflood and Other Stories"],"loc_class":"PS: Language and Literatures: American and Canadian literature","gutenberg":{"url":"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30240","num":30240},"authors":[4],"language":"English","countries":[2],"release_date":"2009-10-13T00:00:00","author":4,"cover":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","summary":"\"Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\" is a short story by Kurt Vonnegut originally written in 1953.

The United States government assembles an expedition in New York City to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French marine biologist and narrator of the story, who happens to be in New York at the time, receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition which he accepts. Canadian whaler and master harpoonist Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful servant Conseil are also brought aboard.\nThe expedition departs Brooklyn aboard the United States Navy frigate Abraham Lincoln and travels south around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean. The ship finds the monster after a long search and then attacks the beast, which damages the ship's rudder. The three protagonists are then hurled into the water and grasp hold of the \"hide\" of the creature, which they find, to their surprise, to be a submarine very far ahead of its era. They are quickly captured and brought inside the vessel, where they meet its enigmatic creator and commander, Captain Nemo.\nThe rest of the story follows the adventures of the protagonists aboard the creature—the submarine, the Nautilus—which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas free from any land-based government. Captain Nemo's motivation is implied to be both a scientific thirst for knowledge and a desire for revenge upon (and self-imposed exile from) civilization. Nemo explains that his submarine is electrically powered and can perform advanced marine biology research; he also tells his new passengers that although he appreciates conversing with such an expert as Aronnax, maintaining the secrecy of his existence requires never letting them leave. Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the undersea adventures, but Ned Land can only think of escape.\nThey visited many places under the ocean, some of them could be found in real life while others were completely fictional. The travelers witness the real corals of the Red Sea, the wrecks of the battle of Vigo Bay, the Antarctic ice shelves, the Transatlantic telegraph cable and the fictional submerged land of Atlantis. The travelers also use diving suits to hunt sharks and other marine life with air-guns and have an underwater funeral for a crew member who died when an accident occurred under mysterious—and unknown to the reader—conditions inside the Nautilus. When the Nautilus returns to the Atlantic Ocean, a pack of \"poulpes\" (usually translated as a giant squid, although in French \"poulpe\" means \"octopus\") attacks the vessel and kills a crew member.\nThroughout the story Captain Nemo is suggested to have exiled himself from the world after an encounter with the forces that occupied his country that had devastating effects on his family. Not long after the incident of the poulpes, Nemo suddenly changes his behavior toward Aronnax, avoiding him. Aronnax no longer feels the same and begins to sympathize with Ned Land. Near the end of the book, the Nautilus is attacked by a warship of some nation that made Nemo suffer. Filled with hatred and revenge, Nemo ignores Aronnax's pleas for mercy. Nemo—nicknamed angel of hatred by Aronnax—destroys the ship, ramming it just below the waterline, sinking it into the bottom of the sea, much to Aronnax's horror, as he watches the ship plunge into the abyss. Nemo bows before the pictures of his wife and children and is plunged into deep depression after this encounter. For several days after this, the protagonists' situation changes. No one seems to be on board any longer and the Nautilus moves about randomly. Ned Land is even more depressed, Conseil fears for Ned's life, and Aronnax, horrified at what Nemo had done to the ship, can no longer stand the situation either. One evening, Ned Land announces an opportunity to escape. Although Aronnax wants to leave Nemo, whom he now holds in horror, he still wishes to see him for the last time. But he knows that Nemo would never let him escape, so he has to avoid meeting him. Before the escape, however, he sees him one last time (although secretly), and hears him say \"Almighty God! Enough! Enough!\". Aronnax immediately goes to his companions and they are ready to escape. But while they loosen the dinghy, they discover that the Nautilus has wandered into the Moskenstraumen, more commonly known as the \"Maelstrom\". They manage to escape and find refuge on a nearby island off the coast of Norway, but the fate of Nautilus is unknown.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas: An Underwater Tour of the World","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.86,"rating_count":121268,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33507.Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea","found":true,"year":1869},"similar_books":["The Lost World & Other Stories","Sandokan: The Pirates of Malaysia","Two Years Before the Mast: A Sailor's Life at Sea","The Jungle Books","The Land That Time Forgot (Caspak, #1-3)","The Prince and the Pauper","The Coral Island","Ivanhoe","The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights","The Currents of Space (Galactic Empire #2)","The Food of the Gods","The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Other Stories","Night Flight","Tanglewood Tales: A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys"],"description":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (French: Vingt mille lieues sous les mers) is a classic science fiction novel by French writer Jules Verne, published in 1870.

Dick, first published in 1953 in Imagination, and later in The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick.

Instead, it relies on life forms. The war has been going on for a long time, and humanity has not been able to come up with a solution against the life-form based ships and mines that the Yuks use. One day, a team of researchers led by Philip Kramer decide to build a spaceship which is powered by a human brain. They find the ideal candidate, Kramer's old professor, a dying man who volunteers to donate his brain to the project.\nThe spaceship is built and on the first test run into outer space, the team discovers that the professor made some changes to the ship, giving him—or rather, his brain—full control over the ship. Sensing trouble, the team flees the ship, leaving the empty ship, piloted by the professor, into outer space. Later, the spaceship returns and kidnaps Kramer and his wife, and on board the ship, the professor's brain informs them that they'll be looking for a new planet to colonize, to start over, as the professor sees no hope in humanity and what it has become- a species which desires, above all else, war.","content_cleaned":true,"classes":["to-read","sci-fi","currently-reading","science-fiction","fiction","kindle","scifi","short-stories","ebook","short-story","audiobooks","philip-k-dick","e-book","sf","nook","sci-fi-fantasy","fantasy","serial-reader","ebooks","space","science","mystery","read-in-2015","books-i-own","english","amazon","audiobook","owned","e-books","classics","favorites","audio","aliens","calibre","drama","1950s","read-2016","own-kindle","2016-reads","read-in-2016","books","freebies","default","owned-to-read","read-in-2014","scifi-fantasy","audible","adventure","space-fiction","i-own","robots","psychologie","outer-space","male-protagonist","unread","war","speculative-fiction","classic","kurzgeschichte","favorite-sci-fi","3-star-reads","y-short-story","y-science-fiction","classic-american-literature","low-priority","to-read-short-story","read-science-fiction-fantasy","title-word-mister-or-doctor","read-2017","science-fiction-fantasy","20th-century-lit","league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen","read-in-2017","ebook-short-stories","shorty-like-me","fantascienza","2000","heard","finish-52-books-in-2017","ficcao","all-time-favorites","04-format-ebook","02-origin-american","01-genre-short-stories","01-genre-scifi","american","my-books","6-scifi-fantasy","dick-philip","undgrad-15-17-tamu","on-librivox-web-site","2016-books","fun-reads","audiobooks-2016","tbr-owned","good-audible-narration","audio-books-in-2016","16reads","short-fiction","new"],"content_available":true,"n_authors":1},{"content_name":"83.txt.utf-8","isbn":"1596051310","original_title":"Around the Moon","author_name":"Jules Verne","images_urls":[],"year":1865,"images":[],"id":28,"category":"Text","plot":"Having been fired out of the giant Columbiad space gun, the Baltimore Gun Club's bullet-shaped projectile, along with its three passengers, Barbicane, Nicholl and Michael Ardan, begins the five-day trip to the moon. A few minutes into the journey, a small, bright asteroid passes within a few hundred yards of them, but does not collide with the projectile. The asteroid had been captured by the Earth's gravity and had become a second moon.\n\nThe three travelers undergo a series of adventures and misadventures during the rest of the journey, including disposing of the body of a dog out a window, suffering intoxication by gases, and making calculations leading them, briefly, to believe that they are to fall back to Earth. During the latter part of the voyage, it becomes apparent that the gravitational force of their earlier encounter with the asteroid has caused the projectile to deviate from its course.\nThe projectile enters lunar orbit, rather than landing on the moon as originally planned. Barbicane, Ardan and Nicholl begin geographical observations with opera glasses. The projectile then dips over the northern hemisphere of the moon, into the darkness of its shadow. It is plunged into extreme cold, before emerging into the light and heat again. They then begin to approach the moon's southern hemisphere. From the safety of their projectile, they gain spectacular views of Tycho, one of the greatest of all craters on the moon. The three men discuss the possibility of life on the moon, and conclude that it is barren. The projectile begins to move away from the moon, towards the 'dead point' (the place at which the gravitational attraction of the moon and Earth becomes equal). Michel Ardan hits upon the idea of using the rockets fixed to the bottom of the projectile (which they were originally going to use to deaden the shock of landing) to propel the projectile towards the moon and hopefully cause it to fall onto it, thereby achieving their mission.\nWhen the projectile reaches the point of neutral attraction, the rockets are fired, but it is too late. The projectile begins a fall onto the Earth from a distance of 160,000 miles, and it is to strike the Earth at a speed of 115,200 miles per hour, the same speed at which it left the mouth of the Columbiad. All hope seems lost for Barbicane, Nicholl and Ardan. Four days later, the crew of a US Navy vessel, USS Susquehanna, spots a bright meteor fall from the sky into the sea. This turns out to be the returning projectile, and the three men inside are found to be alive and are rescued. They are treated to lavish homecoming celebrations as the first people to leave Earth.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"From the Earth to the Moon; and, Round the Moon","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_Moon","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.82,"rating_count":933,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/376974.From_the_Earth_to_the_Moon_and_Round_the_Moon","found":true,"year":-1},"similar_books":["The People That Time Forgot (Caspak, #2)","She and Allan","Tales of Space and Time","The Lost World & Other Stories","The Lady of the Shroud","The Son of the Red Corsair","Down the Bright Way","Gulliver of Mars","Bureaucrats","Night Lamp"],"description":"This darkness... showed that the projectile has passed the atmospheric strata, for the diffused light spread in the air would have been reflected on the metal walls, which reflection was wanting.

E. Smith. It was first serialized in the magazine Amazing Stories in 1934. After the original four novels of the Lensman series were published, Smith expanded and reworked Triplanetary into the first of two prequels for the series. The expanded Triplanetary was published in book form in 1948 by Fantasy Press. The second prequel, First Lensman, was a new original novel published in 1950 by Fantasy Press.\nThe novel covers several episodes in an eons-long human breeding project by the super-intelligences of the Arisians. This alien race is breeding two genetic lines to become the ultimate weapon in Arisia's cosmic war with their arch-enemies, the Eddorians. The initial chapters cover the Kinnison genetic line during the fall of Atlantis and Nero's reign in Rome. These tales were inserted into the novel following the serialized release, along with chapters covering members of the Kinnison line in World Wars One, Two, and Three.\nThe final chapter of Triplanetary tells of the discovery of the inertialess drive that allows faster-than-light travel. Patrolman Conway Costigan and his friends engage in a space battle with Gray Roger the pirate gangster. This conflict is complicated by the arrival of the technologically superior, extra-Solar, amphibian-like Nevians, resulting in the first interstellar war involving humans. In this story Virgil Samms and Roderick Kinnison, important members of the two breeding lines, are introduced.","content_cleaned":true,"classes":["science-fiction","to-read","sci-fi","fiction","space-opera","sf","currently-reading","scifi","owned","default","classics","kindle","ebook","ebooks","sf-fantasy","sci-fi-fantasy","audiobook","classic","novels","adventure","series","pulp","favorites","audiobooks","scifi-fantasy","e-books","audio","e-book","science","to-buy","science-fiction-fantasy","fantasy","reviewed","e-e-doc-smith","sff","aliens","own-might-read","ee-doc-smith","re-read","books","novel","collection","unread","speculative-fiction","unfinished","20th-century","classic-sci-fi","lensmen","literature","paperback","fantasy-sf","to-read-kindle","military-sf","sifi","audible","doc-smith","unowned","space","own-ebook","owned-books","books-i-own","to-read-2","--129-","epic","i-own","3-stars","read-many-times","iown","owned-but-unread","reviewed-books","science-fiction-space-opera","kindle-to-read","have-it","own-to-read","maybe","owned-on-kindle","to-read-science-fiction","read-in-2016","low-likelihood-of-reading","next-in-series","did-not-finish","box-4","to-read-fiction","sci-fi-and-fantasy","to-read-scifi","listened-to-audiobook","s-f","speculative","read-in-2013","500-essential-cult-books","lensman","sf-fantasy-horror","classic-science-fiction","e-reader","sold","vintage","shelved","american","fantasy-scifi","2012-read"],"content_available":true,"n_authors":1},{"content_name":"41562.txt.utf-8","isbn":"1435509943","language_code":"eng","author_name":"Philip K.

G. Wells. The book is based on a prediction of nuclear weapons of a more destructive and uncontrollable sort than the world has yet seen. It had appeared first in serialised form with a different ending as A Prophetic Trilogy, consisting of three books: A Trap to Catch the Sun, The Last War in the World and The World Set Free.\nA frequent theme of Wells's work, as in his 1901 nonfiction book Anticipations, was the history of humans' mastery of power and energy through technological advance, seen as a determinant of human progress. The novel begins: \"The history of mankind is the history of the attainment of external power. Man is the tool-using, fire-making animal. . . . Always down a lengthening record, save for a set-back ever and again, he is doing more.\" (Many of the ideas Wells develops here found a fuller development when he wrote The Outline of History in 1918-1919.) The novel is dedicated \"To Frederick Soddy's Interpretation of Radium,\" a volume published in 1909.\nScientists of the time were well aware that the slow natural radioactive decay of elements like radium continues for thousands of years, and that while the rate of energy release is negligible, the total amount released is huge. Wells used this as the basis for his story. In his fiction,\n\nThe problem which was already being mooted by such scientific men as Ramsay, Rutherford, and Soddy, in the very beginning of the twentieth century, the problem of inducing radio-activity in the heavier elements and so tapping the internal energy of atoms, was solved by a wonderful combination of induction, intuition, and luck by Holsten so soon as the year 1933.\n\nWells's knowledge of atomic physics came from reading William Ramsay, Ernest Rutherford, and Frederick Soddy; the last discovered the disintegration of uranium. Soddy's book Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt praises The World Set Free. Wells's novel may even have influenced the development of nuclear weapons, as the physicist Leï¿½ Szilï¿½rd read the book in 1932, the same year the neutron was discovered. In 1933 Szilï¿½rd conceived the idea of neutron chain reaction, and filed for patents on it in 1934.\nWells's \"atomic bombs\" have no more force than ordinary high explosive and are rather primitive devices detonated by a \"bomb-thrower\" biting off \"a little celluloid stud.\" They consist of \"lumps of pure Carolinum\" that induce \"a blazing continual explosion\" whose half-life is seventeen days, so that it is \"never entirely exhausted,\" so that \"to this day the battle-fields and bomb fields of that frantic time in human history are sprinkled with radiant matter, and so centres of inconvenient rays.\"\n\nNever before in the history of warfare had there been a continuing explosive; indeed, up to the middle of the twentieth century the only explosives known were combustibles whose explosiveness was due entirely to their instantaneousness; and these atomic bombs which science burst upon the world that night were strange even to the men who used them.\n\nWells observes:\n\nCertainly it seems now that nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible. And as certainly they did not see it. They did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands [...] All through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the amount of energy that men were able to command was continually increasing. Applied to warfare that meant that the power to inflict a blow, the power to destroy, was continually increasing [...]There was no increase whatever in the ability to escape [...]Destruction was becoming so facile that any little body of malcontents could use it [...]Before the last war began it was a matter of common knowledge that a man could carry about in a handbag an amount of latent energy sufficient to wreck half a city.\n\nWells viewed war as the inevitable result of the Modern State; the introduction of atomic energy in a world divided resulted in the collapse of society. The only possibilities remaining were \"either the relapse of mankind to agricultural barbarism from which it had emerged so painfully or the acceptance of achieved science as the basis of a new social order.\" Wells's theme of world government is presented as a solution to the threat of nuclear weapons.\n\nFrom the first they had to see the round globe as one problem; it was impossible any longer to deal with it piece by piece. They had to secure it universally from any fresh outbreak of atomic destruction, and they had to ensure a permanent and universal pacification.\n\nThe devastation of the war leads the French ambassador at Washington, Leblanc, to summon world leaders to a conference at Brissago, where Britain's \"King Egbert\" sets an example by abdicating in favor of a world state. Such is the state of the world's exhaustion that the effective coup of this \"council\" (\"Never, of course, had there been so provisional a government. It was of an extravagant illegality.\") is resisted only in a few places. The defeat of Serbia's \"King Ferdinand Charles\" and his attempt to destroy the council and seize control of the world is narrated in some detail.\nBrought to its senses, humanity creates a utopian order along Wellsian lines in short order. Atomic energy has solved the problem of work. In the new order \"the majority of our population consists of artists.\"\nThe World Set Free concludes with a chapter recounting the reflections of one of the new order's sages, Marcus Karenin, during his last days. Karenin argues that knowledge and power, not love, are the essential vocation of humanity, and that \"There is no absolute limit to either knowledge or power.\"\n\n","content_cleaned":false,"classes":["to-read","science-fiction","fiction","classics","sci-fi","kindle","ebook","owned","classic","scifi","post-apocalyptic","literature","h-g-wells","my-ebooks","e-book","to-buy","politics","war","sf","currently-reading","favorites","history","library","dystopian","novels","fantasy","audiobooks","maybe","utopia","dystopia","default","books-i-own","ibooks","british","sci-fi-fantasy","ebooks","science","wells","english","ciencia-ficciï¿½n","english-literature","amazon","philosophy","wish-list","20th-century","futuristic","owned-books","2015-challenge","standalone","to-read-fiction","own-it","audible","speculative-fiction","classic-sci-fi","nuclear","classic-fiction","utopia-dystopia","kindle-books","scifi-fantasy","eb","nuclear-fiction","audio-book","gutenberg","in-english","y-classics","unread-kindle-books","to-read-starting-9-1-17","amazon-library","fiction-classics","shelved","1910-s","abandoned","textbooks-literature","read-2017","to-read-owned","sitting-on-my-bookshelf","fiktio","new","to-sort","western-european","recabar","20th-century-lit","pleasure","my-kindle-books","ci-fi","10s","novels-to-buy","great-fiction-books","distopia","denuncia","fiction-to-read","books-at-library","future-a-to-read","dystopia-apocolyptic","have-read","sci-fy-virtual","the-end-is-nigh","to-read-second","owned-not-read","ibooks-epub"],"content_available":true,"n_authors":1},{"content_name":"97.txt.utf-8","isbn":"048627263X","original_title":"Flatland","year":1884,"author_name":"Edwin Abbott Abbott","images_urls":[],"language_code":"en-US","images":["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Houghton_EC85_Ab264_884f_-_Flatland%2C_cover.jpg","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Houghton_EC85_Ab264_884f_-_Flatland%2C_men_and_women_doors.jpg"],"id":32,"category":"Text","plot":"The story describes a two-dimensional world occupied by geometric figures, whereof women are simple line-segments, while men are polygons with various numbers of sides. The narrator is a square named A Square, a member of the caste of gentlemen and professionals, who guides the readers through some of the implications of life in two dimensions. The first half of the story goes through the practicalities of existing in a two-dimensional universe as well as a history leading up to the year 1999 on the eve of the 3rd Millennium.\nOn New Year's Eve, the Square dreams about a visit to a one-dimensional world (Lineland) inhabited by \"lustrous points\", in which he attempts to convince the realm's monarch of a second dimension; but is unable to do so. In the end, the monarch of Lineland tries to kill A Square rather than tolerate his nonsense any further.\nFollowing this vision, he is himself visited by a three-dimensional sphere named A Sphere, which he cannot comprehend until he sees Spaceland (a tridimensional world) for himself. This Sphere visits Flatland at the turn of each millennium to introduce a new apostle to the idea of a third dimension in the hopes of eventually educating the population of Flatland. From the safety of Spaceland, they are able to observe the leaders of Flatland secretly acknowledging the existence of the sphere and prescribing the silencing of anyone found preaching the truth of Spaceland and the third dimension. After this proclamation is made, many witnesses are massacred or imprisoned (according to caste), including A Square's brother, B.\nAfter the Square's mind is opened to new dimensions, he tries to convince the Sphere of the theoretical possibility of the existence of a fourth (and fifth, and sixth ...) spatial dimension; but the Sphere returns his student to Flatland in disgrace.\nThe Square then has a dream in which the Sphere visits him again, this time to introduce him to Pointland, whereof the point (sole inhabitant, monarch, and universe in one) perceives any communication as a thought originating in his own mind (cf. Solipsism):\n\n\"You see,\" said my Teacher, \"how little your words have done. So far as the Monarch understands them at all, he accepts them as his own – for he cannot conceive of any other except himself – and plumes himself upon the variety of Its Thought as an instance of creative Power. Let us leave this God of Pointland to the ignorant fruition of his omnipresence and omniscience: nothing that you or I can do can rescue him from his self-satisfaction.\"\n\nThe Square recognizes the identity of the ignorance of the monarchs of Pointland and Lineland with his own (and the Sphere's) previous ignorance of the existence of higher dimensions. Once returned to Flatland, the Square cannot convince anyone of Spaceland's existence, especially after official decrees are announced that anyone preaching the existence of three dimensions will be imprisoned (or executed, depending on caste). Eventually the Square himself is imprisoned for just this reason, with only occasional contact with his brother who is imprisoned in the same facility. He does not manage to convince his brother, even after all they have both seen. Seven years after being imprisoned, A Square writes out the book Flatland in the form of a memoir, hoping to keep it as posterity for a future generation that can see beyond their two-dimensional existence.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.81,"rating_count":31437,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433567.Flatland","found":true,"year":1884},"similar_books":["Flatterland: Like Flatland Only More So","Sphereland: A Fantasy about Curved Spaces and an Expanding Universe","The Music of the Primes: Searching to Solve the Greatest Mystery in Mathematics","Unknown Quantity: A Real and Imaginary History of Algebra","What Is Mathematics?: An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods","An Imaginary Tale: The Story of the Square Root of Minus One","The Joy of Pi","Geometry, Relativity and the Fourth Dimension","The Princeton Companion to Mathematics","Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences","The Number Devil: A Mathematical Adventure","Journey through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","The Planiverse: Computer Contact with a Two-Dimensional World","The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of  Paul Erdős and the Search for Mathematical Truth","Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea","A Mathematician's Apology","Naive Set Theory","A History of π"],"description":"As a satire, Flatland offers pointed observations on the social hierarchy of Victorian culture.

While visiting the planet Cassylia, he is challenged by a man named Kerk Pyrrus (secretly the ambassador from the planet Pyrrus) to turn a large amount of money into an immense sum by gambling at a government-run casino. He succeeds and survives the planetary government's desperate efforts to steal back the money. In a fit of ennui, he decides to accompany Kerk to Pyrrus, despite being warned that it is the deadliest world ever colonized by humans.\nPyrrus has a gravity of 2 g; its 42° axial tilt creates severe weather; it has frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions; and possesses two large moons, Samos and Bessos, each creating tides that sometimes combine into rises and falls of up to 30 meters, that have been known to flood active volcanoes and create even more violent weather. Finally, there have been numerous supernovae in its vicinity, meaning that planets in the area are rich in radioactive ores. Pyrrus is the only habitable planet in the area, and the only one from which efforts to mine the area's ores can be sustained, making it a world of incredible potential value. It also means the planet's environment contains high levels of radiation.\nEverything on the planet is predatory, and capable of killing an unwary human instantly. All large animals are strong enough to destroy small vehicles. All small animals have neurotoxic venom. All plants are carnivorous. All microorganisms consume insufficiently protected tissue as quickly as acids. On top of this, all the aforementioned life evolves so quickly that even Kerk and his Pyrran crew have to be retrained upon their return from Cassylia in order to survive.\nBecause of this harsh environment, the settlers are engaged in a ceaseless struggle to survive, which—despite generations of acclimation and a training regime harsher than that of ancient Spartans—they are losing. Their numbers are less than when the planet was first colonized, and they are restricted to a single settlement. The world's very name is a reference to Pyrrhic victory, a success that comes at devastating cost to the victor.\nAfter a futile attempt at acclimating to the harsh planet, dinAlt turns his attentions toward solving the planet's mysteries and saving the faltering colony. The colony's few historical records indicate that the planet's life was once far less hostile to humans, but possess no real answers. The only information that holds any promise is the mention of \"grubbers\", humans living outside the city, to whom the Pyrrans trade hardware for increasingly necessary food.\nAfter several weeks, Jason leaves the city in search of the grubbers, who live in harmony with the harsh environment. They practice what many would consider suicidal forms of animal husbandry, with the assistance of their telepathic \"talkers\". Jason is able to earn their trust by demonstrating his own abilities. The outsiders' knowledge of the initial colonization effort is even more intriguing than that of the city dwellers. Not long after their arrival, animals suddenly began attacking the city, and have not stopped since. However, a number of colonists lived outside the city. Though they still found the planet incredibly harsh, they never suffered such attacks. The grubbers are their descendants. The two factions despise each other. The grubbers hate the city Pyrrans, or \"junkmen\", for cutting them off from space and refusing to trade food or ore for scientific knowledge or advanced technology—particularly medicine. The junkmen hate the grubbers for thriving while they are dying.\nWhile studying the grubber community, he notices an anomaly—though the life-forms throughout the area are dangerous, they are nowhere near as lethal as the ones he encountered around the city. Some grubbers theorize that the initial schism was a disagreement over the city's location, in which the ancestors of the grubbers abandoned the dangerous ground in favor of their current homes. Jason has the grubbers guide him back to the city, so he can see it from the outside. There his psionic senses confirm his hypothesis. Every species of native flora and fauna is psionic, and all life around the city is telepathically \"shouting\" the same thing: KILL THE ENEMY! Pyrrus' biosphere is intentionally attacking the city.\nJason shares this information with the grubbers and wins their total support. They ask Jason to go back to civilization and return with a ship. In return they will reward him handsomely. Jason agrees, but only to get him back to the city. He knows that though the grubbers would keep their word, the first thing they would get from civilization would be weapons with which to make war on the city. He has a better idea, and shares it with Kerk along with the truth about the attacks.\nJason builds a device that can track the intelligence giving commands to the city's life, and puts it in the city's spaceship to search. They detect that the psychic commands emanate from a cave on an island far from the city, and Jason prepares to go down and \"talk\" to what may be an alien intelligence. The junkmen decide instead to attack and kill the intelligence. The resulting battle ends with hundreds dead along with the intelligence after the entire island is destroyed in a nuclear blast. The city is now being attacked even worse than before. Kerk blames Jason for the loss of the attack team (although the order to attack was given by him) and the futility of the plan, since the attacks on the city have not stopped, and prepares to kill him. Jason is barely able to get to an escape pod and leave the ship, but is shot down by Kerk.\nJason crashes into the jungle and is stricken with a Pyrran infection. He awakens in the grubber village without realizing he had fallen unconscious. The grubbers witnessed his escape, and killed a junkman for his medkit to treat Jason. But he is broken inside. He has in effect betrayed the grubbers, and Kerk has probably already convinced the junkmen that the new attacks are his fault. He is about to come clean and give himself over to the grubbers' vengeance when the village's \"quakeman\" gets everyone's attention.\nThe grubbers bundle Jason into a stretcher and follow the quakeman as he runs from the village, accompanied by just about every animal in the area. A tectonic event hits the village, flattening it. The quakeman is a precognitive. The animals reacted the same way, but they can not all have that talent—yet they all ran away together.\nJason realizes the nature of the conflict. But he needs to tell everyone—grubbers and junkmen—at the same time. He plans an attack on the city, based heavily on the talkers. By stirring up an animal attack on the city opposite the spaceport they easily take the spaceship, and therefore the city. Jason is thus able to get the grubbers and junkmen into a room without them killing each other.\nJason now reveals all. Although all life on Pyrrus competes for survival individually, they react collectively to natural disasters. The grubbers, with the assistance of their talkers, have integrated themselves peacefully into the planet's ecosystem, killing only for food or in self-defense. The junkmen, however, think only of killing, and kill everything they can simply because they can. The ecosystem is simply responding in kind, and in fact cultivates mutations around the city dedicated to the sole purpose of killing humans. In short, if a Pyrran animal is not hungry and does not sense hostility, it will not kill. Jason proves this to the junkmen, first by having the grubbers safely handle one of the city's ultralethal species, then doing it himself. The city's science director pretends he is handling a training aid, and is able to do the same.\nWith this knowledge and the cooperation of both Pyrran communities, Jason offers a solution. As the prejudices between the two cultures are generations old, the two communities cannot simply merge. Instead, select junkmen will live among the grubbers to learn their methods of coexistence, and in exchange selected grubbers will be given transport on the city's only spaceship to restore their connection with the rest of humanity. Trade will be continued fairly, with the grubbers trading food and ore to the city Pyrrans for technology and medicines. The educational system will be completely redesigned around grubber survival techniques, after which the city's children will live in new lodgings outside the besieged city—which will remain home to those who cannot adapt to the wilds of Pyrrus. Though the city will inevitably fall to the onslaught, those who have adapted will no longer be grubbers or junkmen, but simply Pyrrans.\nThe junkmen who are unable to adapt to the wilds need not die with the city. There are many worlds with great potential value, but are too harsh to begin colonizing. The unadaptable junkmen can instead adapt these wild frontiers into colonies—as history's first professional pioneers.\nThe story ends with Kerk and the leader of the grubbers making peace. Both are heirs to generations of hatred. \"But they shook hands then because they were both strong men.\"","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"Deathworld","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathworld","found":true},"average_rating":3.94,"rating_count":4370,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2037559.Deathworld_1","found":true,"year":1960},"similar_books":["The Status Civilization","Brain Twister","Звёзды - холодные игрушки (Звёздный лабиринт, #1)","The Pirates of Ersatz","The Goblin Reservation","The High Crusade","Who?","The Green Odyssey","Sargasso Of Space (Solar Queen, #1)","The Planet Buyer","The Whole Man","Davy","Hospital Station (Sector General, #1)","Skylark DuQuesne (Skylark #4)","Tower of Glass","The Mammoth Book of Extreme Science Fiction"],"description":"The planet was called Pyrrus...a strange place where all the beasts, plants and natural elements were designed for one specific purpose: to destroy man.<br />The settlers there were supermen...twice as strong as ordinary men and with milli-second reflexes.

Campbell). The central hero is a gambler who becomes involved with colonists of an extremely hostile planet.\nThere are several hints that the novels take place in the same universe as Harrison's The Stainless Steel Rat series; however, other hints suggest a similar universe but not exactly the same one. For example, at several points in the Deathworld series, the novels mention the Special Corps with Inskipp as its leader; however, the story \"The Mothballed Spaceship\" mentions an armada about to attack Earth—a planet that is long destroyed in the time of The Stainless Steel Rat universe.","content_cleaned":true,"classes":["to-read","science-fiction","sci-fi","fiction","scifi","default","currently-reading","owned","ebook","favorites","fantasy","adventure","kindle","ebooks","english","space-opera","series","speculative-fiction","pfaf","science-fiction-fantasy","sci-fi-fantasy","space","audiobook","classic-sci-fi","harry-harrison","20th-century","librivox","hugo-nominees","read-in-2014","e-book","audiobooks","Библиотека-Галактика","sf-fantasy","books-i-own","action-adventure","e-books","hugo","to-read-sf","sf","to-read-someday","action","1","american","library","scifi-fantasy","sf-f","reviewed","thriller","pulp","audio","science","audio-book","novels","hugo-award-nominee","read-in-english","deathworld","syfy","kindle-books","dystopia","фантастика","science-fiction-space-opera","read-in-2015","sci-fi-to-read","maybe","collection","my-books","kindle-to-read","audio-books","fantasy-scifi","sff","part-of-a-series","to-buy","not-read","dystopian","under-200-pages","giant-creatures","pulp-magazine-like","cryptobotany","unread-on-kindle","novel","on-kindle","bg","read-in-2011","want","planetary-adventure","hugo-award-nominees","msf","to-read-2","fantasy-sf","science-fiction-and-fantasy","borrowed","classic","public-domain-science-fiction","public-domain","1960s","hugo-nominee","fiction-sci-fi","sciencefiction","kindlecollection","novels-books-short-stories-etc"],"content_available":true,"n_authors":1},{"content_name":"1153.txt.utf-8","isbn":"1400130212","original_title":"The Chessmen of Mars","year":1922,"author_name":"Edgar Rice Burroughs","images_urls":[],"language_code":"eng","images":["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Chessmen_of_Mars-1922.jpg","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Martian_Family_of_John_Carter_from_Edgar_Rice_Burroughs_Barsoom_Novels.jpg"],"id":38,"category":"Text","plot":"In this novel Burroughs focuses on a younger member of the family established by John Carter and Dejah Thoris, protagonists of the first three books in the series. The heroine this time is their daughter Tara, princess of Helium, whose hand is sought by the gallant Gahan, Jed (prince) of Gathol. Both Helium and Gathol are prominent Barsoomian city states.\nTara meets Prince Gahan of Gathol, and is initially unimpressed, viewing him as something of a popinjay. Later she takes her flier into a storm and loses control of the craft, and the storm carries her to an unfamiliar region of Barsoom. After landing and fleeing from a pack of ferocious Banths (Martian lions), she is captured by the horrific Kaldanes, who resemble large heads with small, crab-like legs. The Kaldanes have bred a symbiotic race of headless human-like creatures called Rykors, which they can attach themselves to and ride like a horse. The Kaldanes imprison Tara, intending to fatten her up, then eat her. While imprisoned, Tara manages to win over one of the Kaldanes, Ghek, with her lovely singing voice.\nGahan, who has fallen in love with Tara, sets out to find her, only to find himself caught up in the same storm, and he falls overboard while attempting to rescue one of his crew. He stumbles upon Bantoom, realm of the Kaldanes, and manages to rescue Tara, and together with Ghek they flee in Tara's crippled flier. Tara doesn't recognize Gahan as the prince she met earlier, as he is worn from his ordeals and no longer dressed in his fancy clothes. In light of her earlier reaction to him, Gahan decides to keep his identity secret, and identifies himself instead as a Panthan (warrior) called Turan.\nThe three of them manage to reach the isolated city of Manator. Gahan ventures into the city seeking food and water, but is tricked and taken prisoner by the inhabitants. Tara and Ghek are also captured. In Manator, captives are forced to a fight to the death in the arena, in a modified version of Jetan, a popular Barsoomian board game resembling Chess; the living version uses people as the game pieces on a life-sized board, with each taking of a piece being a duel to the death.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The Chessmen of Mars","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chessmen_of_Mars","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.82,"rating_count":4596,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40378.The_Chessmen_of_Mars","found":true,"year":1922},"similar_books":["Almuric","Star Light","The Stars are Also Fire (Harvest of Stars, #2)","Space Viking","Lord Of The Spiders Or Blades Of Mars (Michael Kane, Vol. 2)","The Man of Bronze (Doc Savage, #1)","John Carter of Mars: Warlord of Mars","Tales of Space and Time","All Cats Are Gray","Under the Moons of Mars: New Adventures on Barsoom","Jane Carver of Waar (Jane Carver, #1)","Young Bleys (Childe Cycle, #10)","Sinister Barrier","In Paul Klee's Enchanted Garden","Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan: The Land That Time Forgot","The Repairman","The Door Through Space"],"description":"Impetuous and headstrong, Tara, Princess of Helium and daughter of John Carter, defies the elements by flying into a rare, fierce Martian storm.

American survivors evacuated to gigantic bunkers miles under ground. Sophisticated, radioactivity-immune robots called \"leadys\" continue fighting the war on the devastated surface that is too dangerous for humans. The Soviets have similarly evacuated underground, and each side builds powerful weapons and vehicles for the remote-controlled war they only see from film that the robots deliver.\nThe security department asks Taylor, an American war planner, to observe the interrogation of a leady regarding the progress of the war. Although the robot reports that lethal radioactivity and sophisticated new Soviet weapons continue to make the surface dangerous for humans, the observers find that the leady is not radioactive. Taylor learns that this is the second such robot the security department has found; it assigns him to an expedition, wearing lead suits, to investigate the truth about surface conditions.\nTaylor's group surprises the leadys at the surface and demands to see the outside. Although the robots attempt to delay the humans as long as possible, the group discovers outside the bunker an undamaged valley with forests, animals, and a farm. The leadys reveal that the war ended as soon as the humans evacuated because the robots could not see a rational purpose for it. Analyzing history, they found that groups of humans warred with each other until they matured to overcome conflict. Humanity is almost ready for a single culture, the current worldwide division into American and Soviet sides being the final step. The leadys create counterfeit photographs of the devastated planet to fool humans, while destroying weapons they received and rebuilding the world for their creators' return.\nThe Americans believe that because the Soviets do not know that they were also tricked, the United States can quickly win the war. The robots reveal, however, that during their explanation they sealed all tubes to under ground. Although this prevents the expedition from leaving, the leadys expect that by the time their countrymen dig new tunnels, humanity will be ready for the truth. The robots invite Taylor and the others to join a group of Soviets who were similarly stranded after visiting the surface. \"The working out of daily problems of existence\", the leadys suggest, \"will teach you how to get along in the same world. It will not be easy, but it will be done.\"","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The Defenders","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(short_story)","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.97,"rating_count":758,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6472311-the-defenders","found":true},"similar_books":["Youth","With Morning Comes Mistfall","The Big Trip Up Yonder by Kurt Vonnegut, Science Fiction, Literary","The Constitution of the United States with the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation","The Children's Story","The U.S. Constitution: And Fascinating Facts about It","The Snows of Kilimanjaro/The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber","Empire","A Place So Foreign and Eight More","The Repairman","Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde: The Devoted Friend/The Nightingale and the Rose","Christmas in the Trenches","Eight O'Clock in the Morning","The Boy Who Cried Wolf","Press Enter","The Defendant","The Dark Age","The Big Jump"],"loc_class":"PS: Language and Literatures: American and Canadian literature","gutenberg":{"url":"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28767","num":28767},"authors":[8],"language":"English","countries":[2],"release_date":"2009-05-12T00:00:00","author":8,"cover":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","summary":"\"The Defenders\" is a 1953 science fiction novelette by American author Philip K.

Like THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES and THE FIREMAN, the story demonstrates Bradbury’s characteristic blending so early in his career of the sentimental and the transcendent, the homely and the mystical. Bradbury’s old women in space and their strange outcome are reminiscent of his more famous story KALEIDOSCOPE (published in THE ILLUSTRATED MAN) and its conclusion shows unusual if understated power. Bradbury’s THE FIREMAN (the short-form version of FAHRENHEIT 451 which was doubled in length for its book publication in 1953) appeared in the February 1951 issue of GALAXY and further solidified GALAXY’s reputation, as a magazine of unprecedented originality and ambition. Gold’s commitment to the highly ambitious THE FIREMAN was, then, courageous for its time and gave publicity to the editor’s insistence that GALAXY was an entirely new kind of science fiction magazine, one which was far more oriented toward style and controversial social extrapolation than the other markets ever had been. Although THE FIREMAN and THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES had been published earlier to significant attention, Bradbury in 1951 was by no means a writer of substantial reputation and his work was regarded by most science fiction editors and readers as marginal to the genre.<br /><br />About the Author: Ray Douglas Bradbury (b. 1920) entered science fiction as a teenage Los Angeles fan frantic to sell John W. Campbell and become a major science fiction writer; although he eventually sold Campbell two very short stories in the early ’40s, his career took a different direction, first through the second- and third-level science fiction magazines (PLANET, STARTLING STORIES) and then to the literary quarterlies and women’s magazines (HARPER’S BAZAAR, CHARM) where his distinctive stylistic elegance led him to the Best American Short Stories and O. Henry Prize anthologies. He was regarded with the somewhat similar lyrical short story writer Truman Capote as among the most promising of the emerging generation. With THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES he became famous both inside and outside science fiction; subsequent collections (THE ILLUSTRATED MAN, DANDELION WINE) advanced his reputation. He wrote the screenplay for John Huston’s film adaptation of MOBY DICK (1953), and in the decades to follow hundreds of short stories and novels (A MEDICINE FOR MELANCHOLY), which cemented his reputation. He was awarded a Medal in Literature by George W. Bush in 2004.<br /><br />About The Galaxy Project: Horace Gold led GALAXY magazine from its first issue dated October 1950 to science fiction’s most admired, widely circulated and influential magazine throughout its initial decade. Its legendary importance came from publication of full length novels, novellas and novelettes. GALAXY published nearly every giant in the science fiction field.<br /><br />The Galaxy Project is a selection of the best of GALAXY with new forewords by some of today’s best science fiction writers. The initial selections in alphabetical order include work by Ray Bradbury, Frederic Brown, Lester del Rey, Robert A. Heinlein, Damon Knight, C. M. Kornbluth, Walter M. Miller, Jr., Frederik Pohl, Robert Sheckley, Robert Silverberg, William Tenn (Phillip Klass) and Kurt Vonnegut with new Forewords by Paul di Filippo, David Drake, John Lutz, Barry Malzberg and Robert Silverberg. The Galaxy Project is committed to publishing new work in the spirit GALAXY magazine and its founding editor Horace Gold.","loc_class":"PS: Language and Literatures: American and Canadian literature","gutenberg":{"url":"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51171","num":51171},"authors":[18],"language":"English","countries":[2],"release_date":"2016-02-10T00:00:00","author":18,"cover":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","content_cleaned":true,"classes":["to-read","science-fiction","sci-fi","currently-reading","short-stories","gutenberg","e-books","21st-century-lit","calibre","trippy","travel","they-call-it-literary-fiction","the-funnies","surreal","religion-philosophy","literary-gasm","in-your-closet-in-your-head","i-like-em-short","favourite-authors","drama-drama-drama","dissssstopia","badass-women","short-stories-novellas","fantasy","read_2016","not-interested","pg","short-fiction","read-2016","novellas","fiction-20th-century","american-fiction","winter-20152016","shortstory-shortstories-novellas","published-1951","author-love","gutenberg-project","finished-sci-fi-speculative-fiction","to-read-overdrive-ebooks","kindle-unlimited"],"content_available":true,"n_authors":1},{"content_name":"49525.txt.utf-8","isbn":"1882968107","original_title":"First Lensman","year":1950,"author_name":"E.

On Barsoom nothing can break an engagement between a man and woman except death, although the new suitor may not cause that death. Thus it is that Thuvia will have none of him. This situation leaves Carthoris in a predicament.\nAs Thuvia suffers the common Burroughsian heroine's fate of being kidnapped and in need of rescue, Carthoris' goal is abetted by circumstances. Thus he sets out to find the love of his life. His craft is sabotaged and he finds himself deep in the undiscovered south of Barsoom, in the ruins of ancient Aanthor. Thuvia's kidnappers, the Dusar, have taken her there as well, and Carthoris is just in time to spot Thuvia and her kidnappers under assault by a green man of the hordes of Torquas. Carthoris leaps to her rescue in the style of his father.\nThe rescue takes Carthoris and his love to ancient Lothar, home of an ancient fair-skinned human race gifted with the ability to create lifelike phantasms from pure thought. They habitually use large numbers of phantom bowmen paired with real and phantom banths (Barsoomian lions) to defend themselves from the hordes of Torquas.\nThe kidnapping of Thuvia is done in such a way that Carthoris is blamed. This ignites a war between the red nations of Barsoom. Carthoris must try to be back in time with Thuvia to stop the war from breaking loose. Carthoris wonders if his love will ever be requited by the promised Thuvia.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"Thuvia, Maid of Mars","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuvia,_Maid_of_Mars","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.75,"rating_count":5558,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40387.Thuvia_Maid_of_Mars","found":true,"year":1920},"similar_books":["The Stars are Also Fire (Harvest of Stars, #2)","Lord Of The Spiders Or Blades Of Mars (Michael Kane, Vol. 2)","Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan: The Land That Time Forgot","Star Light","The Conquering Sword of Conan (Conan the Cimmerian, #3)","Armageddon 2419 A.D.","Children of the Lens (Lensman, #6)","John Carter of Mars: Warlord of Mars","The Repairman","All Cats Are Gray","The Man of Bronze (Doc Savage, #1)","Space Viking","Tales of Space and Time","Sinister Barrier","The Mystery of Cloomber","The Door Through Space"],"description":"Mars has become divided by love.

During their journey there, they see people's behaviour become excitable and erratic. On arrival they are ushered into a sealed room, along with Challenger and his wife. In the course of his researches into various phenomena, Challenger has predicted that the Earth is moving into a belt of poisonous ether which, based on its effect on the people of Sumatra earlier in the day, he expects to stifle humanity. Challenger seals them in the room with cylinders of oxygen, which he (correctly) believes will counter the effect of the ether.\n\nThe five wait out the Earth's passage through the poison belt as they watch the world outside, human and animal, die and machines run amok. (According to Victorian values – or to Doyle's understanding of them – Challenger's servants are left outside the sealed room, and they continue to perform their duties until the ether overtakes them.) Finally, the last of the oxygen cylinders is emptied, and they open a window, ready to face death. To their surprise, they do not die, and conclude the Earth has now passed through the poison belt. They journey through the dead countryside in Challenger's car, finally arriving in London. They encounter only one survivor, an elderly, bed-ridden woman prescribed oxygen for her health.\nAfter returning to Challenger's house, they discover that the effect of the ether is temporary, and the world reawakens with no knowledge that they have lost any time at all. Eventually Challenger and his companions manage to convince the world what happened – a task made easier by the tremendous amount of death and destruction caused by runaway machines and fires that took place while the world was asleep – and humanity is shocked into placing a higher value on life.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The Poison Belt","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poison_Belt","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.56,"rating_count":1257,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/272751.The_Poison_Belt","found":true,"year":1913},"similar_books":["الغرفة الحمراء","Lost Face","(الرجل الذي يجمع كتب (بو","Fury","مغامرات أرسين لوبين","Tarzan Series (Tarzan, #1-8)","D'ARTAGNAN ROMANCES: The Three Musketeers, Twenty Years After, The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la Valliere, The Man in the Iron Mask (FLT Classics Series)","The Master of the World","The Hollow Lands (Dancers at the End of Time, #2)","خلف جدار النوم","كتب الدم","Study Bible KJV - Scofield Reference Bible","Professor Dowell's Head","القتل بدون مقدم أتعاب","The White Chief","The Crimson Fairy Book","1984 ج2","The Case of the Waylaid Wolf"],"description":"<blockquote>\"Nothing could be done.

Bedford rents a small countryside house in Lympne, in Kent, where he wants to work in peace. He is bothered every afternoon, however, at precisely the same time, by a passer-by making odd noises. After two weeks Bedford accosts the man, who proves to be a reclusive physicist named Mr. Cavor. Bedford befriends Cavor when he learns he is developing a new material, cavorite, which can negate the force of gravity.\nWhen a sheet of cavorite is prematurely processed, it makes the air above it weightless and shoots off into space. Bedford sees in the commercial production of cavorite a possible source of \"wealth enough to work any sort of social revolution we fancied; we might own and order the whole world\". Cavor hits upon the idea of a spherical spaceship made of \"steel, lined with glass\", and with sliding \"windows or blinds\" made of cavorite by which it can be steered, and persuades a reluctant Bedford to undertake a voyage to the moon; Cavor is certain there is no life there.\nOn the way to the moon, they experience weightlessness, which Bedford finds \"exceedingly restful\". On the surface of the moon the two men discover a desolate landscape, but as the sun rises, the thin, frozen atmosphere vaporizes and strange plants begin to grow with extraordinary rapidity. Bedford and Cavor leave the capsule, but in romping about get lost in the rapidly growing jungle. They hear for the first time a mysterious booming coming from beneath their feet. They encounter \"great beasts\", \"monsters of mere fatness\", that they dub \"mooncalves\", and five-foot-high \"Selenites\" tending them. At first they hide and crawl about, but growing hungry partake of some \"monstrous coralline growths\" of fungus that inebriate them. They wander drunkenly until they encounter a party of six extraterrestrials, who capture them. The insectoid lunar natives (referred to as \"Selenites\", after Selene, the moon goddess) are part of a complex and technologically sophisticated society that lives underground, but this is revealed only in radio communications received from Cavor after Bedford's return to earth.\nBedford and Cavor break out of captivity beneath the surface of the moon and flee, killing several Selenites. In their flight they discover that gold is common on the moon. In their attempt to find their way back to the surface and to their sphere, they come upon some Selenites carving up mooncalves but fight their way past. Back on the surface, they split up to search for their spaceship. Bedford finds it but returns to Earth without Cavor, who injured himself in a fall and was recaptured by the Selenites, as Bedford learns from a hastily scribbled note he left behind.\nChapter 19, \"Mr. Bedford in Infinite Space\", plays no role in the plot but is a remarkable set piece in which the narrator describes experiencing a quasi-mystical \"pervading doubt of my own identity. . . the doubts within me could still argue: 'It is not you that is reading, it is Bedford—but you are not Bedford, you know. That's just where the mistake comes in.' 'Counfound it!' I cried, 'and if I am not Bedford, what am I? But in that direction no light was forthcoming, though the strangest fancies came drifting into my brain, queer remote suspicions like shadow seem from far away... Do you know I had an idea that really I was something quite outside not only the world, but all worlds, and out of space and time, and that this poor Bedford was just a peephole through which I looked at life...\"\nBy good fortune, the narrator lands in the sea off the coast of Britain, near the seaside town of Littlestone, not far from his point of departure. His fortune is made by some gold he brings back, but he loses the sphere when a curious boy named Tommy Simmons climbs into the unattended sphere and shoots off into space. Bedford writes and publishes his story in The Strand Magazine, then learns that \"Mr. Julius Wendigee, a Dutch electrician, who has been experimenting with certain apparatus akin to the apparatus used by Mr. Tesla in America\", has picked up fragments of radio communications from Cavor sent from inside the moon. During a period of relative freedom Cavor has taught two Selenites English and learned much about lunar society.\nCavor's account explains that Selenites exist in thousands of forms and find fulfillment in carrying out the specific social function for which they have been brought up: specialization is the essence of Selenite society. \"With knowledge the Selenites grew and changed; mankind stored their knowledge about them and remained brutes—equipped,\" remarks the Grand Lunar, when he finally meets Cavor and hears about life on Earth. Unfortunately, Cavor reveals humanity's propensity for war; the lunar leader and those listening to the interview are \"stricken with amazement\". Bedford infers that it is for this reason that Cavor has been prevented from further broadcasting to Earth. Cavor's transmissions are cut off as he is trying to describe how to make cavorite. His final fate is unknown, but Bedford is sure that \"we shall never… receive another message from the moon\".","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The First Men in the Moon","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Men_in_the_Moon","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.69,"rating_count":8615,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/536478.The_First_Men_in_the_Moon","found":true,"year":1901},"similar_books":["Dark Benediction","The Complete Roderick","Helliconia Trilogy","Life During Wartime","Downward to the Earth","The Child Garden","The Centauri Device","Sirius: A Fantasy of Love and Discord","Emphyrio","R.U.R. & War with the Newts","The Land That Time Forgot (Caspak, #1-3)","Jem","From the Earth to the Moon (Extraordinary Voyages, #4)","Cities in Flight (Cities in Flight, #1-4)","The Dancers at the End of Time (Dancers at the End of Time, #1-3)","Pavane","Now Wait for Last Year","Floating Worlds"],"description":"When penniless businessman Mr Bedford retreats to the Kent coast to write a play, he meets by chance the brilliant Dr Cavor, an absent-minded scientist on the brink of developing a material that blocks gravity.

The Mahars are all female, reproducing parthogenetically by means of a closely guarded \"Great Secret\" contained in a Mahar book. David learns that they also feast on selected human captives in a secret ritual. In a disturbance, David manages to escape Phutra, becomes lost, and experiences a number of adventures before sneaking back into the city. Rejoining Abner, he finds the latter did not even realize he was gone, and the two discover that time in Pellucidar, in the absence of objective means to measure it, is a subjective thing, experienced by different people at different rates.\nObsessed with righting the wrong he has unwittingly done Dian, David Innes escapes again and eventually finds and wins her by defeating the malevolent Jubal the Ugly One, another unwanted suitor. David makes amends, and he and Dian wed.\nLater, along with Ghak and other allies, David Innes and Abner Perry lead a revolt of humankind against the cruel Mahars. Their foes are hampered by the loss of the Great Secret, which David has stolen and hidden. To further the struggle David returns to the Iron Mole, in which he and Dian propose to travel back to the surface world to procure outer world technology. Only after it is underway does he discover that Hooja the Sly One has substituted a drugged Mahar for Dian the Beautiful.\nBack in the world we know David meets the author, who after hearing his tale and seeing his prehistoric captive, helps him resupply and prepare the mole for the return to Pellucidar.","genres":[],"copyright":"Copyrighted.

Rogers recounts the events of the “Second War of Independence” that precedes the first victory of Americans over Hans, in which he plays an important role.\nBorn in 1898, he was a veteran of the Great War (World War I) and was by 1927 working for the American Radioactive Gas Corporation. He was investigating reports of unusual phenomena in abandoned coal mines near Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania. On December 15, while investigating one of the lower levels of a mine, there was a cave-in. Exposed to radioactive gas, Rogers fell into \"a state of suspended animation, free from the ravages of katabolic processes, and without any apparent effect on physical or mental faculties.\" Rogers remained in “sleep” for 492 years.\nHe awakens in 2419 and, thinking he has been asleep for just several hours, wanders for a few days in unfamiliar forests (what had been Pennsylvania almost five centuries before). He finally notices a wounded boy-like-figure, clad in strange clothes and moving in giant leaps, who appears to be under attack by others. He defends the person, killing one of the attackers and scaring off the rest. It turns out that he is helping a woman, Wilma Deering, who, on “air patrol”, was attacked by an enemy gang, the \"Bad Bloods\", which is presumed to have allied themselves with the Hans.\nWilma takes Rogers to her camp, where he is to meet the bosses of her gang. He is invited to either stay with their gang or leave and visit other gangs. They hope Rogers’ experience and the knowledge he gained fighting in the First World War may be useful in their struggle with the Hans.\nRogers stays with the gang for several days, learns about the community life of Americans in the 25th century, and makes friends with the people, especially with Wilma, with whom he spends a lot of time. He also experiences a Han air raid, during which he manages to destroy one of the enemy ships. Rogers and his friends hurry to the bosses to report the incident and explain the method he has used when shooting the aircraft. As the raid has caused much destruction, there is suspicion that the location of the gang’s industrial plants may have been revealed to the Hans by rival gangs. They await a fight with the Hans who will likely wish to take revenge for the destruction of their airship.\nThe bosses direct Wilma and Rogers to investigate the wreck. While there, a Han party arrives to investigate as well. Thanks to Rogers’ quick and wise instructions, he and Wilma manage to escape as well to shoot down some more of the Han’s ships. The day after, Wilma and Anthony get married, and Rogers becomes a member of the gang. Meantime, knowing Rogers’ technique, the other gangs start the hunt for Han ships. The Hans respond by improving the security of their ships, forcing the Americans to develop new tactics to press their sudden advantage and identify the traitors working with the Han.\nAnthony develops a plan to get the records of the traitorous transaction, which are kept somewhere in the Han city of Nu-Yok. With the help of other gangs, he creates a team that will go with him. They learn that the traitors are the Sinsings, the gang located not far from Nu-Yok.\nThe Americans appreciate Rogers’ courage and brave deeds and, grateful to him, make him the new boss. He instantly reorganizes the governing structures of the gang by creating new offices and makes plans for the battle with the Sinsings, again using the knowledge he gained in the First World War. The raid on Sinsings turns out to be a great success and gives the Americans the confidence in their ability to overcome the Hans.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"Armageddon—2419 A.D.","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon_2419_A.D.","found":true},"average_rating":3.31,"rating_count":304,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/627939.Armageddon_2419_A_D_","found":true,"year":1928},"similar_books":["Flandry of Terra (Ensign Flandry 3)","The Defiant Agents (Time Traders/Ross Murdock, #3)","Star Trek 6","The Adolescence of P-1","The Cosmic Computer (aka Junkyard Planet)","The Song of the Axe (The Pelbar Cycle, #6)","Invaders from the Infinite","The Fox Run (Endworld, #1)","The Land Leviathan: A New Scientific Romance (Oswald Bastable, #2)","Stellar Fox (Castle Federation #2)","The Nightmare Begins (The Survivalist, #2)","Traitor Winds (Star Trek: The Lost Years, #3)","From the Depths","Vulcan's Glory","The Lost Continent"],"description":"The original ‘Buck Rogers’ SF classic.

He finds himself in the same location (Boston, Massachusetts), but in a totally changed world: It is the year 2000 and, while he was sleeping, the United States has been transformed into a socialist utopia. The remainder of the book outlines Bellamy's thoughts about improving the future. The major themes include problems associated with capitalism, a proposed socialist solution of a nationalization of all industry, the use of an \"industrial army\" to organize production and distribution, as well as how to ensure free cultural production under such conditions.\nThe young man readily finds a guide, Doctor Leete, who shows him around and explains all the advances of this new age; including drastically reduced working hours for people performing menial jobs and almost instantaneous, Internet-like delivery of goods. Everyone retires with full benefits at age 45, and may eat in any of the public kitchens. The productive capacity of the United States is nationally owned, and the goods of society are equally distributed to its citizens. A considerable portion of the book is dialogue between Leete and West wherein West expresses his confusion about how the future society works and Leete explains the answers using various methods, such as metaphors or direct comparisons with 19th-century society.\nAlthough Bellamy's novel did not discuss technology or the economy in detail, commentators frequently compare Looking Backward with actual economic and technological developments. For example, Julian West is taken to a store which (with its descriptions of cutting out the middleman to cut down on waste in a similar way to the consumers' cooperatives of his own day based on the Rochdale Principles of 1844) somewhat resembles a modern warehouse club like BJ's, Costco, or Sam's Club. He additionally introduces a concept of \"credit\" cards in chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, 25, and 26, but these actually function like modern debit cards. All citizens receive an equal amount of \"credit.\" Those with more difficult, specialized, dangerous or unpleasant jobs work fewer hours (in contrast to the real-world practice of paying them more for their efforts of, presumably, the same hours). Bellamy also predicts both sermons and music being available in the home through cable \"telephone\" (already demonstrated but commercialized only in 1890 as Théâtrophone in France). Bellamy labeled the philosophy behind the vision \"nationalism\", and his work inspired the formation of more than 160 Nationalist Clubs to propagate his ideas.\nDespite the \"ethical\" character of his socialism (though he was initially reluctant to use the term \"socialism\"), Bellamy's ideas somewhat reflect classical Marxism. In Chapter 19, for example, he has the new legal system explained. Most civil suits have ended in socialism, while crime has become a medical issue. The idea of atavism, then current, is employed to explain crimes not related to inequality (which Bellamy thinks will vanish with socialism). Remaining criminals are medically treated. One professional judge presides, appointing two colleagues to state the prosecution and defense cases. If all do not agree on the verdict, then it must be tried over. Chapter 15 and 16 have an explanation of how free, independent public art and news outlets could be provided in a more libertarian socialist system. In one case Bellamy even writes \"the nation is the sole employer and capitalist\".","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"Looking Backward, 2000 to 1887","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_Backward","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.27,"rating_count":2653,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/296977.Looking_Backward","found":true,"year":1888},"similar_books":["News from Nowhere and Other Writings","A Modern Utopia","A Crystal Age","Red Star","Ecotopia","The City of the Sun","Erewhon (Erewhon , #1)","Democracy: An American Novel","Swastika Night","Social Darwinism in American Thought","The Night of the Long Knives","The Learning Tree","Viriconium Nights","Theodore Roosevelt","A Journey in Other Worlds: A Romance of the Future","The Wonder","A Hazard of New Fortunes","All Creatures Great and Small, All Things Bright and Beautiful, and All Things Wise and Wonderful: Three James Herriot Classics"],"description":"Edward Bellamy's classic look at the future has been translated into over twenty languages and is the most widely read novel of its time.

While looking through the book, Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel find a coded note written in runic script along with the name of a 16th-century Icelandic alchemist, Arne Saknussemm. (This was a first indication of Verne's love for cryptography. Coded, cryptic or incomplete messages as a plot device would continue to appear in many of his works and in each case Verne would go a long way to explain not only the code used but also the mechanisms used to retrieve the original text.) Lidenbrock and Axel transliterate the runic characters into Latin letters, revealing a message written in a seemingly bizarre code. Lidenbrock attempts a decipherment, deducing the message to be a kind of transposition cipher; but his results are as meaningless as the original.\nProfessor Lidenbrock decides to lock everyone in the house and force himself and the others (Axel, and the maid, Martha) to go without food until he cracks the code. Axel discovers the answer when fanning himself with the deciphered text: Lidenbrock's decipherment was correct, and only needs to be read backwards to reveal sentences written in rough Latin. Axel decides to keep the secret hidden from Professor Lidenbrock, afraid of what the Professor might do with the knowledge, but after two days without food he cannot stand the hunger and reveals the secret to his uncle. Lidenbrock translates the note, which is revealed to be a medieval note written by the (fictional) Icelandic alchemist Arne Saknussemm, who claims to have discovered a passage to the centre of the Earth via Snï¿½fell in Iceland. In what Axel calls bad Latin, the deciphered message reads:\n\nIn Snefflls [sic] Iokulis kraterem kem delibat umbra Skartaris Iulii intra kalendas deskende, audas uiator, te [sic] terrestre kentrum attinges. Kod feki. Arne Saknussemm.\n\nIn slightly better Latin, with errors amended:\n\nIn Sneffels Jokulis craterem, quem delibat umbra Scartaris, Julii intra kalendas descende, audax viator, et terrestre centrum attinges; quod feci. Arne Saknussemm\n\nwhich, when translated into English, reads:\n\nDescend, bold traveller, into the crater of the jï¿½kull of Snï¿½fell, which the shadow of Scartaris touches (lit: tastes) before the Kalends of July, and you will attain the centre of the earth. I did it. Arne Saknussemm\n\nProfessor Lidenbrock is a man of astonishing impatience, and departs for Iceland immediately, taking his reluctant nephew with him. Axel, who, in comparison, is cowardly and anti-adventurous, repeatedly tries to reason with him, explaining his fears of descending into a volcano and putting forward various scientific theories as to why the journey is impossible, but Professor Lidenbrock repeatedly keeps himself blinded against Axel's point of view. After a rapid journey via Kiel and Copenhagen, they arrive in Reykjavï¿½k, where the two procure the services of Hans Bjelke (a Danish-speaking Icelander eiderdown hunter) as their guide, and travel overland to the base of the volcano.\nIn late June, they reach the volcano, which has three craters. According to Saknussemm's message, the passage to the center of the Earth is through the one crater that is touched by the shadow of a nearby mountain peak at noon. However, the text also states that this is only true during the last days of June. During the next few days, with July rapidly approaching, the weather is too cloudy for any shadows. Axel silently rejoices, hoping this will force his uncle – who has repeatedly tried to impart courage to him only to succeed in making him even more cowardly still – to give up the project and return home. Alas for Axel, however, on the second to last day, the sun comes out and the mountain peak shows the correct crater to take.\nAfter descending into the crater, the three travellers set off into the bowels of the Earth, encountering many strange phenomena and great dangers, including a chamber filled with firedamp, and steep-sided wells around the \"path\". After taking a wrong turn, they run out of water and Axel almost dies, but Hans taps into a neighbouring subterranean river. Lidenbrock and Axel name the resulting stream the \"Hansbach\" in his honour and the three are saved. At another point, Axel becomes separated from the others and is lost several miles from them. Luckily, a strange acoustic phenomenon allows him to communicate with them from some miles away, and they are soon reunited.\nAfter descending many miles, following the course of the Hansbach, they reach an unimaginably vast cavern. This underground world is lit by electrically charged gas at the ceiling, and is filled with a very deep subterranean ocean, surrounded by a rocky coastline covered in petrified trees and giant mushrooms. The travelers build a raft out of trees and set sail. The Professor names this sea the \"Lidenbrock Sea\" and the port as \"Port Grï¿½uben\", after the name of his goddaughter. While on the water, they see several prehistoric creatures such as a giant Ichthyosaurus, which fights with a Plesiosaurus and wins. After the battle between the monsters, the party comes across an island with a huge geyser, which Lidenbrock names \"Axel Island\".\nA lightning storm again threatens to destroy the raft and its passengers, but instead throws them onto the coastline. This part of the coast, Axel discovers, is alive with prehistoric plant and animal life forms, including giant insects and a herd of mastodons. On a beach covered with bones, Axel discovers an oversized human skull. Axel and Lidenbrock venture some way into the prehistoric forest, where Professor Lidenbrock points out, in a shaky voice, a prehistoric human, more than twelve feet in height, leaning against a tree and watching a herd of mastodons. Axel cannot be sure if he has really seen the man or not, and he and Professor Lidenbrock debate whether or not a proto-human civilization actually exists so far underground. The three wonder if the creature is a man-like ape, or an ape-like man. The sighting of the creature is considered the most alarming part of the story, and the explorers decide that it is better not to alert it to their presence as they fear it may be hostile.\nThe travellers continue to explore the coastline, and find a passageway marked by Saknussemm as the way ahead. However, it is blocked by what appears to be a recent cave-in and two of the three, Hans and the Professor, despair at being unable to hack their way through the granite wall. The adventurers plan to blast the rock with gun cotton and paddle out to sea to escape the blast. Upon executing the plan, however, they discover that behind the rockfall was a seemingly bottomless pit, not a passage to the center of the earth. The travellers are swept away as the sea rushes into the large open gap in the ground. After spending hours being swept along at lightning speeds by the water, the raft ends up inside a large volcanic chimney filling with water and magma. Terrified, the three are rushed upwards, through stifling heat, and are ejected onto the surface from a side-vent of a stratovolcano. When they regain consciousness, they discover that they have been ejected from Stromboli, a volcanic island located in southern Italy. They return to Hamburg to great acclaim – Professor Lidenbrock is hailed as one of the great scientists of history, Axel marries his sweetheart Grï¿½uben, and Hans eventually returns to his peaceful life in Iceland. The Professor has some regret that their journey was cut short.\nAt the very end of the book, Axel and Lidenbrock realize why their compass was behaving strangely after their journey on the raft. They realize that the needle was pointing the wrong way after being struck by an electric fireball which nearly destroyed the wooden raft.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"A Journey into the Interior of the Earth","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.84,"rating_count":89545,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32829.Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth","found":true,"year":1864},"similar_books":["The First Men in the Moon","The Vicomte de Bragelonne (The D'Artagnan Romances, #3.1)","King Solomon's Mines (Allan Quatermain, #1)","The Lost World (Professor Challenger, #1)","Le tigri di Mompracem","The Lost Continent","Erewhon (Erewhon , #1)","Fantï¿½mas (Fantï¿½mas, #1)","A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","Kidnapped (David Balfour, #1)","The Joy of Life (Les Rougon-Macquart, #12)","The Collected Stories of Arthur C.

It purports to be the narrative of Bowen J. Tyler, an American passenger with his Airedale Terrier Nobs on a ship sunk in the English Channel by a German U-boat, U-33, in 1916. He is rescued by a British tugboat with another survivor, Lys La Rue. The tug is also sunk, but its crew manages to capture the submarine when it surfaces. Unfortunately, all other British craft continue to regard the sub as an enemy, and they are unable to bring it to port. Sabotage to the navigation equipment sends the U-33 astray into the South Pacific. The imprisoned German crew retakes the sub and begins a raiding cruise, only to be overcome again by the British. A saboteur continues to guide the sub off course, and by the time he is found out it is in Antarctic waters.\nThe U-33 is now low on fuel, with its provisions poisoned by the saboteur Benson. A large island ringed by cliffs is encountered, and identified as Caprona, a land mass first reported by the fictitious Italian explorer Caproni in 1721 whose location was subsequently lost. A freshwater current guides the sub to a stream issuing from a subterranean passage, which is entered on the hope of replenishing the water supply. The U-boat surfaces into a tropical river teeming with primitive creatures extinct elsewhere; attacked, it submerges again and travels upstream in search of a safe harbor. It enters a thermal inland sea, essentially a huge crater lake, whose heat sustains Caprona’s tropical climate. As the sub travels north along the island’s waterways the climate moderates and wildlife undergoes an apparent evolutionary progression.\nOn the shore of the lake the crew builds a palisaded base, dubbed Fort Dinosaur for the area’s prehistoric fauna. The British and Germans agree to work together under Tyler, with Bradley, the mate from the tug, as second in command and Von Schoenvorts, the original sub commander, in control of the Germans. The castaways are attacked by a horde of beast men and take prisoner Ahm, a Neanderthal Man. They learn that the native name for the island is Caspak. Oil is discovered, which they hope to refine into fuel for the U-33. As they set up operations, Bradley undertakes various explorations. During his absence Lys disappears and the Germans abscond with the submarine.\nTyler leaves the other survivors to seek and rescue Lys. A series of adventures ensues among various bands of near-human primitives, each representing a different stage of human advancement, as represented by their weaponry. Tyler rescues Lys from a group of Sto-lu (\"hatchet men\"), and later aids the escape of a woman of the Band-lu (spearmen) to the Kro-lu (bowmen). Lys is lost again, and chance discoveries of the graves of two men associated with Bradley’s expedition leaves Tyler in despair of that party’s fate. Unable to find his way back to Fort Dinosaur, he retreats to the barrier cliffs ringing Caspak in a vain hope of attracting rescue from some passing ship. Improbably reunited with Lys, he sets up house with her, completes the account of his adventures which he has been writing, and casts it out to sea in his thermos.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The Land That Time Forgot","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Land_That_Time_Forgot_(novel)","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.81,"rating_count":1167,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377791-the-land-that-time-forgot","found":true,"year":1918},"similar_books":["A Passion In The Desert","Bertram Cope's Year","For the Love of Letters: A 21st-Century Guide to the Art of Letter Writing","The Quest of the Sacred Slipper","Ambrose Bierce's Write It Right: The Celebrated Cynic's Language Peeves Deciphered, Appraised, and Annotated for 21st-Century Readers","Mademoiselle Fifi and Other Stories","The Complete Hammer's Slammers Volume 2","How to Tell a Story: The Secrets of Writing Captivating Tales","A Book of Remarkable Criminals","How to Write Killer Fiction","The Call of the Canyon","Mentor: A Memoir","Cabbages and Kings","Dirge (Founding of the Commonwealth, #2)","Sayings of the Buddha: New Translations from the Pali Nikayas","On Writing Romance: How to Craft a Novel That Sells","Bolo Brigade (Bolo, #4)","Man, Oh Man!

He wakes up in 2100. He later learns that he has inherited huge wealth and that his money has been put into a trust. Over the years, the trustees, the \"White Council\", have used his wealth to establish a vast political and economic world order.\nWhen he wakes Graham is disoriented. The people around him had not expected him to wake up, and are alarmed. Word spreads that the \"Sleeper\" has awakened. A mob gathers around the building and demands to see the fabled Sleeper. The people around Graham will not answer his questions. They place Graham under house arrest. Graham learns that he is the legal owner and master of most of the world.\nRebels led by Ostrog help Graham to escape. They say that the people need Graham's leadership to rise against the White Council. Unconvinced, but unwilling to remain a prisoner, Graham goes with them. Graham arrives at a massive hall where the workers have gathered to prepare for the revolution. They march against the White Council but are soon attacked by the state police. In the confusion, Graham is separated from the revolutionaries. He meets an old man who tells him the story of the Sleeper - the White Council invested his wealth to buy the industries and political entities of half the world, establishing a plutocracy and sweeping away parliament and the monarchy. The Sleeper is just a figurehead. The old man thinks that the Sleeper is a made-up figure used to brainwash the population.\nGraham meets Ostrog, who says that the rebels have won and that the people are demanding that the Sleeper should rule. Ostrog retains power while Graham becomes his puppet ruler. Graham gets interested in aeroplanes and learns how to fly. He sees from the air that no-one lives in the country or small towns any more, all agriculture being run like industry; and that there are now only four huge cities in Britain, all powered by huge wind-mills. His carefree life ends when Helen tells him that for the lower class the revolution has changed nothing. Graham questions Ostrog who admits that the lower classes are still dominated and exploited but defends the system. It emerges that Ostrog only wanted to take power for himself and has used the revolution and Graham to do so.\nOstrog admits that in other cities the workers have continued to rebel even after the fall of the White Council. Ostrog has used a black African police force to get the workers back in line. Graham is furious and demands that Ostrog keep his police out of London. Ostrog agrees. Graham decides to examine this new society for himself.\nGraham visits London in disguise to see how the workers live. Their lives are ghastly. Unskilled workers toil in factories, paid in food for each days work, with no job security. They speak a dialect so strong that Graham cannot understand them. Industrial diseases are rife. Workers wear uniforms of different colour according to their trade. The family unit no longer exists and children are cared for in huge institutions. Lives are dominated by \"babble machines\" which spread news and \"pleasure cities\" where unspecified joys are available. \"Euthanasy\" is considered normal.\nGraham learns that Ostrog has ordered his troops to London. Graham confronts Ostrog, who tries to arrest Graham. The workers rise up again and help Graham to escape. He meets Helen and learns that it was she who told the public about Ostrog's treachery. Graham leads the liberation of London.\nOstrog escapes and joins his troops who are flying to London. His men still hold a few airports. The workers find anti-aircraft guns, but they need time to set them up. The revolutionaries have only one aircraft; Graham gives away all of his wealth to the rebels and proceeds to fly the one aircraft against the invaders, bringing some of them down. The revolutionaries get the anti-aircraft guns working and start to shoot down the invaders. Graham attacks Ostrog's aeroplane but fails. Graham's aeroplane crashes.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"When the Sleeper Wakes","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleeper_Awakes","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.42,"rating_count":1576,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80939.When_the_Sleeper_Wakes","found":true,"year":1899},"similar_books":["The Coming Race","Caesar's Column: A Story of the Twentieth Century","The Iron Heel","A Strange Manuscript found in a Copper Cylinder","Off On A Comet","The Mortal Immortal: The Complete Supernatural Short Fiction of Mary Shelley","Ayesha: The Return of She","The Lost Continent: The Story of Atlantis","The Complete Moon Trilogy: The Moon Maid/The Moon Men/The Red Hawk","The Fortunes of Captain Blood","The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters, Volume Two (Miss Temple, Doctor Svenson, and Cardinal Chang #1.2)","The Lost World & Other Stories","One","Georgia on My Mind and Other Places","A Prisoner in Fairyland","House of Corruption","The Blazing World and Other Writings","Erewhon (Erewhon , #1)"],"description":"Graham, an 1890s radical pamphleteer who is eagerly awaiting the twentieth century and all the advances it will bring, is stricken with insomnia.

Though the original idea for the novel was Smith's, he co-wrote the first part of the novel with Lee Hawkins Garby, the wife of his college classmate and later neighbor Carl Garby. The novel starts as an edisonade, but turns into a space travel adventure when the characters goes into deep space. The Skylark of Space is considered to be one of the earliest novels of interstellar travel and the first example of space opera. Originally serialized in 1928 in the magazine Amazing Stories, it was first published in book form in 1946 by the Buffalo Book Co. The novel was followed by three sequels, beginning with Skylark Three.","content_cleaned":false,"classes":["to-read","sci-fi","science-fiction","scifi","sf","owned","fiction","default","space-opera","currently-reading","classics","kindle","series","ebooks","fantasy","space","sf-fantasy","e-book","sci-fi-fantasy","owned-books","adventure","e-e-doc-smith","novel","ebook","paperback","unread","collection","doc-smith","classic","science-fiction-and-fantasy","ee-doc-smith","science-fiction-fantasy","skylark","vintage-science-fiction-paperback","1","paperbacks","books-i-own-but-haven-t-read","audiobooks","mine","didn-t-finish","smith-ee-doc","tbr","sff","re-read","classic-sf","audiobook","s-f","e-books","sold","fantasy-sf","golden-age-sf","golden-age","vintage","shelved","sf-horror-fantasy","audible","science","opera","american","to-get","to-buy","public-domain-science-fiction","public-domain","pulp","not-read","novels","dk-scifi-encyclopedia-reading-list","inspirational-media-starfinder","to-read-sometime","own-print","to-read-2019","sci-fiction","on-calibre-to-read","thai","00-to-read-01","_next-in-series","to-read-complete","childhood","f-bc1_s5_f","next-up-later-free","read-owned","pulp-science-fiction","pg","galaktyka-gutenberga","20th-century-lit","17-new","fiction-classics","sci-fi-fantasy-horror","what-i-grew-up-on","26-may-2014","31","hard-sf","books","old-library","1950s","2017-read-hard","rh17-7","comics-and-graphic-novels","passtime","hgsfw"],"content_available":true,"n_authors":2},{"content_name":"21873.txt.utf-8","original_title":"Planet of the Damned","author_name":"Harry Harrison","images_urls":["http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21873/21873-h/images/bantam_logo.jpg"],"year":1962,"images":["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/37/PlanetOfTheDamned.jpg"],"id":67,"category":"Text","plot":"Brion Brandd lives on the planet Anvhar which due to an elliptical orbit experiences a year with a long cold winter and a short hot summer to which the population have become adapted.

As he recovers from the games Brandd meets Ihjel, a previous winner of the Twenties, who asks him to join a mission on the desert planet of Dis. The ruling class of Dis, the magter, have threatened to transport cobalt bombs onto a neighbouring planet if they refuse to surrender. As a result the planet is being blockaded and under threat of a pre-emptive nuclear strike. Brandd travels to Dis with Ihjel and a scientist from Earth called Lea but on arrival the trio are attacked and Ihjel is killed. After encounters with the local population and other humans Brandd starts to put together the reason for the magter's seemingly suicidal aggression. Brandd learns that most life on Dis survives the extremes of the planet by using symbiosis. The magter though have been infected by a parasite that destroys the higher functions of their brains.

Hoping for a chance to escape, Ross volunteers to join Operation Retrograde and is taken by Major John Kelgarries to a base built under the ice near the North Pole. Teamed with archaeologist Gordon Ashe, he is trained to mimic a trader of the Beaker culture of Bronze-Age Europe.\nSent back to southern Britain around 2000 B.C.E., Ross and Ashe (as Rossa and Assha) find that their outpost has been bombed, destroyed by the wrath of Lurgha, the local storm god, according to two of the natives. Discovering the direction whence the bomber came and other clues pointing to the general area occupied by the Soviet base, Ross, Ashe, and McNeil, the lone survivor of the bombing, go to that area.\nSomewhere near the Baltic Sea, Ross, Ashe, and McNeil begin building a Beaker trading post and learn from the locals that to their southeast lies a land populated by ghosts, a land whither no man of good sense would go. Ross gets separated from Ashe and McNeil in a night attack and must go into the taboo area alone in an effort to find them. Far inside the ghostland he finds the Soviet base and is captured by the Reds.\nIn an effort to escape Ross steps onto the base’s transporter plate and is transferred to a Soviet base even further back in time. The Reds recapture him and take him outside the base, abandoning him on a glacier to freeze to death. He climbs out of the crevice into which he was shoved and follows the trail leading away from the Soviet base, coming to a giant globe half buried in the ice. Half dead from the abuse he has received, he enters the globe and then falls through a panel and into a tub full of transparent-red gel.\nWhen he regains consciousness Ross discovers that all of his wounds are healed, he is no longer hungry or thirsty, and his Beakerman clothing is gone. A mechanism offers him a skin-tight suit made of an iridescent dark-blue fabric that covers all but his head and his hands. He explores what is clearly some kind of ship and is recaptured by the Reds, but not before he activates the ship’s communication system and comes face to face with a hostile-looking humanoid with a large bald head.\nThe Reds’ interrogation of Ross is interrupted by explosions that rock the base. Ross is reunited with Ashe and McNeil and the three men escape to the time transporter, pausing only to steal some recording tapes. Back in the Soviet Bronze-Age base, the men leave the time-travel building and escape from the village just as the alien Baldies attack. The men then make their way to the river that will take them to the Baltic Sea to be picked up by their submarine.\nRoss is again separated from Ashe and McNeil when he falls off their hastily built and uncontrollable raft. He discovers that the Baldies are hunting him when he is captured by warriors from a barbarian tribe. Again he escapes and continues down the river, reaching the sea and the camp occupied by Ashe and/or McNeil only hours after the sub took them away. Two of the Baldies attempt to capture him with telepathic hypnosis, but they flee when Kelgarries and his men arrive. Leaving the alien skinsuit on the beach, so that the Baldies can’t trace the Americans to their base, the men take Ross to the sub and home. There Ashe tells him that the tapes he stole indicate other alien spaceships abandoned on Earth, at least three of them in the Americas. Operation Retrograde is about to become much more interesting and Ross still wants to be part of the action.\nThe 2000 version: Norton modified the 1958 version by making three changes in the text;\n1. She reset the story in the first quarter of the Twenty-First Century instead of in the last quarter of the Twentieth, shifting the action futureward by a full generation.\n2. The Reds have become the Russians and Greater Russia has replaced the Soviet Union.\n3. Space travel has not gone beyond the first lunar landings instead of having not gotten beyond the first attempts to put satellites into orbit. Instead of being ridiculed as impossible, space travel is publicly ridiculed as infeasible.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The Time Traders","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Traders","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.74,"rating_count":2374,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/462373.The_Time_Traders","found":true,"year":1958},"similar_books":["Seas of Venus (Seas of Venus, #1-2)","The Creatures of Man","The Forlorn","Keith Laumer: The Lighter Side","In the Heart of Darkness (Belisarius, #2)","The Warslayer: The Incredibly True Adventures of Vixen the Slayer, the Beginning","The Colors of Space","The Hub: Dangerous Territory (The Hub)","Planetfall (Genellan, Bk. 1)","Neptune Crossing (Chaos Chronicles, #1)","The Cross-Time Engineer (Conrad Stargard, #1)","Badge of Infamy","Med Ship (Med Service, #1-4)","Stars Over Stars (Heyoka Blackeagle, #2)"],"description":"DRAFTED INTO THE ARMY OF TIME<p>Intelligence agents have uncovered something which seems beyond belief, but the evidence is incontrovertible: the USAs greatest adversary on the world stage is sending its agents back through time!

Ross and Loketh are captured by seafaring Rovers, then join them. They liberate a Rover island captured by the Baldies. Ross convinces a coalition of natives the Baldies are playing them against one another. Ross finds Ashe at last, in the company of the mystic and advanced Foanna, who turn out to be only three, the last of their race. The Foanna set a trap for the Baldies, using their castle as bait, but they cannot win against the whole force without increasing their numbers. Ross and Ashe agree to a process mentally joining them with the Foanna. A second encounter with the Baldies, they win. In a final encounter, Ross is teleported to a Baldy ship like the one familiar to him from Galactic Derelict, and sets its course to a random destination. The main Baldy installation is simultaneously attacked and the Baldies driven off the planet.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"Key Out of Time","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Out_of_Time","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.82,"rating_count":823,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1183822.Key_Out_of_Time","found":true,"year":1963},"similar_books":["The Colors of Space","Skylark Three","Armageddon 2419 A.D.","Invaders from the Infinite","Police Your Planet","Beyond the Farthest Star","Children of Morrow","Hot Sky at Midnight","The Survivors (Ragnarok, #1)","The Earth Lords","The Spider and the Fly (The Spiderverse Saga, #1)","The Night of the Long Knives","American Epidemic: Origins- An Ebola Prepper Survival Tale","The Cosmic Computer (aka Junkyard Planet)"],"description":"Key Out of Time -- the fourth book in the Time Traders series, following The Time Traders, Galactic Derelict, and The Defiant Agents -- again features Ross Murdock as the hero.

It was first published in 1963, and as of 2012, had been reprinted in 17 editions with cover changes, as well as twice in a combined edition with The Defiant Agents. It is part of Norton's Forerunner universe.\nKey Out of Time continues the series’ premise, an encounter between Western heroes, and the Russian Communists, and the Baldies, a mysterious alien race that used time travel to alter Earth. Events in the previous novel, The Defiant Agents, are treated as a Time Agent failure — but read that novel for a different interpretation. The setting of this novel is a world, Hawaika, appearing to be a tropical paradise.\nKirkus Reviews, strongly supportive after following the series for years, writes, “Again, Andre Norton, one of the greats among writers of teenage science fiction (Galactic Derelict, 1959, p.658, J-316, for one), has employed [her] boundless imagination… Owing to the author’s exceptional mastery of detail, and astute control of plot, Key Out of Time stands as a novel which should more than satisfy young science fiction fanciers and fanatics.”","content_cleaned":true,"classes":["to-read","science-fiction","currently-reading","fiction","sci-fi","owned","andre-norton","sf","kindle","scifi-fantasy","scifi","time-travel","ebook","fantasy","books-i-own","science-fiction-fantasy","calibre","e-books","adventure","aldiko","science","paperback","ya-f-sf","sci-fi-fantasy","default","ebooks","to-read-kindle","liked-it","my-books","audiobook","norton","owned-books","kindle-books","time-traders","free","e-book","time","sf-fantasy","speculative-fiction","audiobooks-read","3-stars","missing-shelf","on-calibre-to-read","audible","aown","2-series","actually-own","1a-toppicks-own","eown","in-google-drive-to-read","20th-century-lit","time-traders-andre-norton","want-to-read-later","a-owned","a-ebook","library","kindle-freebie-orm","tsundoku","read-in-2016","i-own-a-copy","a-norton","sf-time-travel","digital","dropbox","gave-up","priority-reads","pending","scif-fi","classic-science-fiction","have-audio","tbr-later-complete","wobble","m","paper","own-audiobook","science-fiction-and-fantasy","2016-read","randy-s-books","later","amazon","my-youth","library-2016","shelved","syfy-to-read","box2","hoarded-books","to-read-maybe","to-check-out","series-eventually","bin-009","all_non-trek_unread","sff-to-read","shelfari-science-fiction","shelfari-review-only","shelfari-part-of-a-set","shelfari-no","shelfari-kindlebook","shelfari-eo","shelfari-andre-norton","fiction-science-fiction"],"content_available":true,"n_authors":1},{"content_name":"1329.txt.utf-8","isbn":"0803280041","original_title":"A Voyage to Arcturus","year":1920,"author_name":"David Lindsay","images_urls":[],"language_code":"en-GB","images":["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c4/A_Voyage_to_Arcturus_%28first_edition%29.jpg"],"id":75,"category":"Text","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"A Voyage to Arcturus","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Voyage_to_Arcturus","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.62,"rating_count":1511,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1064084.A_Voyage_to_Arcturus","found":true,"year":1920},"similar_books":["The Emperor of Dreams","Black Gods and Scarlet Dreams","The Second Book of Lankhmar  (Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser #5-7)","The Mark of the Beast and Other Horror Tales (Dover Horror Classics)","The Conan Chronicles: Volume 2: The Hour of the Dragon (The Conan Chronicles, #2)","Time And The Gods","The House on the Borderland and Other Novels","Sea-Kings of Mars and Otherworldly Stories","The Well of the Unicorn","Voice of Our Shadow","The Worm Ouroboros","Hello Summer, Goodbye","Darker Than You Think","The Green Pearl and Madouc (Lyonesse, #2-3)","Three Hearts and Three Lions","The Dragon Waiting","Viriconium","The Coming Race"],"description":"A stunning achievement in speculative fiction, <i>A Voyage to Arcturus</i> has inspired, enchanted, and unsettled readers for decades.

As he journeys northward, guided by a drumbeat, he encounters a world and its inhabitants like no other, where gender is a victory won at dear cost; where landscape and emotion are drawn into an accursed dance; where heroes are killed, reborn, and renamed; and where the cosmological lures of Shaping, who may be God, torment Maskull in his astonishing pilgrimage.

It combines fantasy, philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. Described by critic and philosopher Colin Wilson as the \"greatest novel of the twentieth century\", it was a central influence on C. S. Lewis' Space Trilogy. J. R. R. Tolkien said he read the book \"with avidity\". Clive Barker has stated \" A Voyage to Arcturus is a masterpiece\" and called it \"an extraordinary work . . . quite magnificent.\"\nAn interstellar voyage is the framework for a narrative of a journey through fantastic landscapes. The story is set at Tormance, an imaginary planet orbiting Arcturus, which, in the novel (but not in reality) is a double star system, consisting of stars Branchspell and Alppain. The lands through which the characters travel represent philosophical systems or states of mind, through which the main character, Maskull, passes on his search for the meaning of life.\n\n","content_cleaned":false,"classes":["to-read","fantasy","currently-reading","science-fiction","fiction","sci-fi","favorites","philosophy","sf","fantasy-masterworks","scifi","classics","owned","novels","sci-fi-fantasy","ebooks","classic","kindle","literature","novel","speculative-fiction","library","e-books","1920s","20th-century","books-i-own","scifi-fantasy","shelfari-wishlist","default","ebook","sf-fantasy","weird","e-book","fantasy-sci-fi","have","guardian-1000","science-fiction-and-fantasy","uk","not-read","british","to-buy","wish-list","i-own","maybe","on-kindle","dnf","horror","free","did-not-finish","audiobook","audiobooks","my-library","surreal","to-read-sci-fi","kindle-edition","space-opera","science-fantasy","books","speculative","abandoned","allegory","to-read-soon","planetary-romance","spec-fic","adventure","ithaki-bilimkurgu-klasikleri","to-read-science-fiction","ithaki-bilimkurgu-klasikleri-dizisi","epub","bilimkurgu","backlog","kitaplığım","alınacaklar","tr-sci-fi","mysticism","english-literature","recommended","shelfari-favorites","owned-books","fantascienza","sciencefiction","have-it","unread","to-read-fiction","fiction-20th-century","never-finished","in-english","c-s-lewis","unfinished","unrated","public-domain","to-get","reviewed","would-read-again","read-in-2014","bg-eng","1000-novels","librivox","classic-sci-fi","1000-books"],"content_available":true,"n_authors":1},{"content_name":"29019.txt.utf-8","author_name":"Andre Norton","images_urls":["http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29019/29019-h/images/cover.jpg"],"year":1953,"id":76,"category":"Text","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"All Cats Are Gray","wikipedia":{"found":false},"average_rating":3.45,"rating_count":289,"cover_art_url":"http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/29019/pg29019.cover.medium.jpg","goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6522491-all-cats-are-gray","found":true,"year":1953},"similar_books":["The Mountain of Marvels: A Celtic Tale of Magic, Retold from the Mabinogion","Grace Immaculate","Wonder Tales: Six French Stories of Enchantment","The Demon You Know (Demon-Hunting Soccer Mom #4.5)","Tarzan Triumphant (Tarzan, #15)","Inconstant Star (Man-Kzin Wars)","The Cat Who Walked a Thousand Miles","Specimen 313","Space Viking","Steel Walls and Dirt Drops","Agent of Vega & Other Stories","Smoked","Breaths in Winter","First Flight","Happily Ever After (Girls to the Rescue #1)","The Spoils of War (The Damned, #3)","Rath's Reckoning (The Janus Group #3)","Little Girl Lost (The Valley of Ten Crescents, #0.5)"],"description":"Under normal conditions a whole person has a decided advantage over a handicapped one.

It is a peaceful reign, held by compact and not by conquest. Again and again, when rebellion threatens the Terran Peace, the natives of the rebellious world have turned against their own people and sided with the men of Terra; not from fear, but from a sense of dedication. <br /><br />There has never been open war. The battle for these worlds is fought in the minds of a few men who stand between worlds; bound to one world by interest, loyalties and allegiance; bound to the other by love. <br /><br />Such a world is Wolf. Such a man was Race Cargill of the Terran Secret Service… <br /><br />At one time Race Cargill had been the best Terran Intelligence agent on the complex and mysterious planet of Wolf. He had repeatedly imperiled his life amongst the half-human and non-human creatures of the sullen world. And he had repeatedly accomplished the fantastic missions until his name was emblazoned with glory. <br /><br />But that had all seemingly ended. For six long years he'd sat behind a boring desk inside the fenced-in Terran Headquarters, cut off there ever since he and a rival had scarred and ripped each other in blood-feud. <br /><br />But when The Door Through Space swung suddenly open, the feud was on again—and with it a plot designed to check and destroy the Terran Empire.","loc_class":"PS: Language and Literatures: American and Canadian literature","gutenberg":{"url":"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19726","num":19726},"authors":[25],"pages":204,"language":"English","isbn13":"9780843959086","countries":[2],"release_date":"2006-11-06T00:00:00","author":25,"cover":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","summary":"The Door Through Space is a 1961 science fiction novel by American writer Marion Zimmer Bradley.

Tyler, Lys La Rue, and the other castaways marooned on the large Antarctic island of Caprona, whose tropical interior, known to its inhabitants as Caspak, is home to prehistoric fauna of all eras. Tyler's recovered manuscript detailing their ordeal is delivered to his family, and the relief effort is put together by Tom Billings, secretary of the Tyler shipbuilding business. The expedition's ship, the Toreador, locates Caprona, and while the bulk of the crew attempts to scale the encircling cliffs Billings flies over them in an aircraft.\nBillings' plane is attacked by flying reptiles and forced down in the interior of Caspak. He saves a native girl named Ajor from a large cat and a group of ape-men, and undertakes to accompany her back to her people, the fully human Galus, while she educates him in the language and mysteries of the island. They travel north, encountering various creatures of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, as well as additional primitive subhuman races. They pass through the lands of the Neanderthal Bo-lu (club men) and the more advanced Sto-lu (hatchet men), who are easily cowed by gunfire. But in the country of the Band-lu (spear men) he is taken captive, and despairs until rescued in turn by Ajor. They resume their journey, re-encountering and befriending Tomar, a Band-lu newly become Kro-lu (bow man). Tomar and his mate So-al are the first examples Billings has actually seen of Caspakian evolutionary metamorphosis in action.\nAfter an interlude in which Ajor's back story is related the new friends separate. Billings and Ajor enter Kro-lu territory and save Chal-az, a Kro-lu warrior, from a group of Band-lu. Visiting the Kro-lu village as his guest, they are parted again when Billings is attacked through the machinations of the chief Du-seen, who has designs on Ajor. They escape individually, making for the Galu country. Du-seen goes after Ajor with some of his warriors.\nBillings catches and tames an ancestral horse, with the aid of which he rescues Ajor from Du-seen. Pursued, they resign themselves to death, but are relieved by a force consisting of Bowen Tyler, Galu warriors, and the rescue crew from the Toreador, which had successfully scaled the cliffs and entered Caspak after Billings' ill-fated airplane flight. All are reunited in the Galu village, where Tyler and Lys La Rue have been formally married by the captain of the Toreador. Billings and Ajor also desire to wed, but Ajor may not leave Caspak due to her status as cos-ata-lo – she was born a fully evolved Galu rather than attaining that form through metamorphosis, and hence is treasured by her people. Billings elects to remain in Caspak to be with her.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The People That Time Forgot","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People_That_Time_Forgot_(novel)","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.7,"rating_count":1152,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1041041.The_People_That_Time_Forgot","found":true,"year":1918},"similar_books":["The Babylonian Legends of Creation and the Fight Between Bel and the Dragon","From the Earth to the Moon and 'Round the Moon","Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan: The Land That Time Forgot","The Complete Hammer's Slammers Volume 2","Brand of the Werewolf (Doc Savage, #5)","30 Days in the Word Mines","Who?","Bolo Brigade (Bolo, #4)","Cormac Mac Art (The Robert E.

alien library discovered in the previous novel proved to have locations of many unknown worlds. Finding the secure location of planet Topaz compromised, Apache operatives, including Travis Fox, are sent on an emergency trip by Earth with a mind-altering machine, Redax, that crash lands. They discover they have the ability to communicate with the coyotes, but have no idea why they are there. They encounter Russians who have undergone similar treatment, and similarly lacking their memories, who were taken from the days of the Mongolian Golden Horde.

It was first published in 1962, and as of 2012, had been reprinted in ten editions with cover changes, as well as twice in a combined edition with Key Out of Time. It is part of Norton's Forerunner universe.\nThe Defiant Agents continues the series’ premise, an encounter between Western heroes, and the Russian Communists, and a mysterious alien race that has used time travel to alter Earth. Most interaction in this novel is in an American Indian-like setting.\nKirkus Reviews comments, “Andre Norton, a polished writer of science fiction, weaves [her] outlandish fare in patterns intricate enough to attract the most devoted addict.

The loss of solar heating has caused the Earth's atmosphere to freeze into thick layers of \"snow\". The boy's father had worked with a group of other scientists to construct a large shelter, but the earthquakes accompanying the disaster had destroyed it and killed the others. He managed to construct a smaller, makeshift shelter called the \"Nest\" for his family, where they maintain a breathable atmosphere by periodically retrieving pails of frozen oxygen to thaw over a fire. They have survived in this way for a number of years.\nAt the end, they are found by a search party from a large group of survivors at Los Alamos, where they are using nuclear power to provide heat and have begun using rockets to search for other survivors (radio being ineffective at long range without an ionosphere). They reveal that other groups of humans have survived at Argonne, Brookhaven, and Harwell nuclear research facilities as well as in Tannu Tuva, and that plans are being made to establish uranium-mining colonies at Great Slave Lake or in the Congo region.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"A Pail of Air","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pail_of_Air","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":3.93,"rating_count":138,"cover_art_url":"http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/51461/pg51461.cover.medium.jpg","goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/297432.A_Pail_of_Air","found":true,"year":1956},"similar_books":["The Best of John W.

Julius and girlfriend Lil are working with the committee (called an ad hoc) that oversees the Magic Kingdom's Liberty Square. Dan, who has hit rock bottom and lost all his Whuffie, doesn't believe in rejuvenation and wishes to die, but not while he's at rock bottom. He moves in with Julius and Lil in order to rebuild his life. At the park, Julius is murdered and soon refreshed. By the time he wakes up, Debra's ad hoc group has taken control of the Hall of Presidents, and is planning to replace its old-fashioned animatronic robots with the synthetic memory imprinting of the experience of being the president for a moment. Julius believes that this rival committee had him killed as a distraction so that they could seize the Hall in the interim.\nFearing that they will next try to revamp his favorite ride, the Haunted Mansion, he resolves to take a stand against the virtualization of the park, endangering his relationship with both Lil and Dan; eventually Lil leaves Julius for Dan. Julius finally “cracks” when he sees his dreams turned to dust and he bashes up the attractions in the Hall of Presidents, in the process also damaging his own cranial interface to the point that he can no longer back himself up. This pushes his Whuffie to ground level when he is caught and gives Debra and her colleagues enough “sympathy Whuffie” to take over the Haunted Mansion, by invitation of the same fans that Julius had recruited to work in the Mansion.\nDan leaves Lil, Julius is kicked out of the ad hoc and his Whuffie hits rock bottom — low enough that others take his possessions with impunity and elevators don’t stop for him. Then comes the revelation: a few days before Dan's planned suicide by lethal injection, Dan reveals that it was in fact he who had arranged to kill Julius, in collusion with Debra, in exchange for the Whuffie that her team could give him. Dan had asked one of his converts from his missionary days, a young girl, to do the dirty work. Debra then had herself restored from a backup made before this plan, so that she would honestly believe that she wasn't involved. He makes this public; Debra is thrown out, Julius gets sympathy Whuffie and, ironically enough, he develops a friendly affection for his sweet young murderer. He never restores himself, because doing so would erase his memories of that entire year, his last with Dan, but lives with his damaged interface. The book is his attempt to manually document the happenings of the previous year so that, when this incarnation is eventually killed by age or accident, his restored backup will have a partial record of the transpiring events. Dan decides not to take a lethal injection, but to deadhead (putting oneself into a voluntary coma) till the heat death of the Universe.","genres":[],"copyright":"Copyrighted.

Even worse, the menacing and contemptuous Fenachrones are threatening to conquer the galaxy and wipe out all who oppose them. And don’t forget the dastardly machinations of Seaton’s arch-nemesis, DuQuesne, who embarks on a nefarious mission of his own.

main protagonist of the novel is Dane Thorson, Cargo-master-apprentice on the Free Trader rocket ship the Solar Queen. Free Traders take on trading contracts on remote and recently discovered planets, which can be dangerous and unpredictable.\nThe Solar Queen has recently obtained a valuable trading contract on the planet Sargol and are building a relationship with one of the races on the planet, the cat-like Salariki. The process goes slowly till the Salariki discover that the Solar Queen is carrying catnip and other plants from Terra that are unknown on Sargol. The traders exchange what little of the plants they have for the rare and valuable Koros stones and collect a native red-colored wood to exchange at home. At the last minute the storm priests of the Salariki demand that the Solar Queen take a pre-paid contract to return within 6 months with more plants.\nA few days after leaving the planet, several members of the crew suffer from attacks, which start with severe headaches and end in a semi-coma state. Only 4 of the younger members of the crew are unaffected, including Dane Thorson. Upon exiting hyperspace on return to the vicinity of Terra, the crew discovers that they are pariah and have been declared a plague ship.\nOn the short hop to earth, the crew discovers that pests have invaded the ship and are the cause of the illness. In a final bid to prove their case they kidnap a medic and present his evidence by video to a solar-system-wide audience, which is successful.\nIn the meantime the rest of the crew have recovered, and after a final effort of negotiation the Solar Queen preserves its reputation by selling the contract with the Salariki to a large intergalactic trading company in exchange for credits and a quiet inter-solar mail route, which should lead to no more trouble.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"Plague Ship","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_Ship","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":4.02,"rating_count":1139,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/961291.Plague_Ship","found":true},"similar_books":["The Colors of Space","Four Day Planet","Police Your Planet","Broken Bulbs","TNT: Telzey Amberdon & Trigger Argee Together","The Skylark of Space (Skylark #1)","Beginning Operations: A Sector General Omnibus (Sector General, #1-3)","Black Projects, White Knights: The Company Dossiers (The Company, #4.5)","City at World's End","Fury","A Plague of Demons & Other Stories","The Humanoid Touch (Humanoids, #2)","Path of the Fury","Otherness","The Survivors (Ragnarok, #1)","Dinosaur Planet Survivors (Dinosaur Planet, #2)"],"description":"Lured by exotic gems and valuable oils, the crew of the space trader Solar Queen landed on the newly discovered planet Sargol, only to find their most ruthless competitor there ahead of them.

Underhill was furious as he closed the door behind himself. It didn't make much sense to wear a uniform and look like a soldier if people didn't appreciate what you did. He sat down in his chair, laid his head back in the headrest and pulled the helmet down over his forehead. As he waited for the pin-set to warm up, he remembered the girl in the outer corridor. She had looked at it, then looked at him scornfully. \"Meow.\" That was all she had said. Yet it had cut him like a knife. What did she think he was—a fool, a loafer, a uniformed nonentity? Didn't she know that for every half hour of pinlighting, he got a minimum of two months' recuperation in the hospital? By now the set was warm. He felt the squares of space around him, sensed himself at the middle of an immense grid, a cubic grid, full of nothing. Out in that nothingness, he could sense the hollow aching horror of space itself and could feel the terrible anxiety which his mind encountered whenever it met the faintest trace of inert dust.","loc_class":"PS: Language and Literatures: American and Canadian literature","gutenberg":{"url":"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29614","num":29614},"authors":[35],"language":"English","countries":[2],"release_date":"2009-08-05T00:00:00","author":35,"cover":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","content_cleaned":true,"classes":["to-read","science-fiction","sci-fi","short-stories","sf","favorites","currently-reading","cats","scifi","audiobooks","space-opera","cordwainer-smith","audio","nook","fiction","short-fiction","audiobook","sci-fi-works-other","junk","sf-fantasy","owned","sci-fi-classic","sci-fi-initial-eras","librivox-audiobooks","lesser-known-books","fresh-weird-creative-plot","sff","read-in-80s-or-90s","competition-with-nikos","audible","sci-fi-single","find-a-copy","s-f","on-librivox-web-site","2016-reading-list","scif-fi","the-great-courses","guys-read","good-and-proper-science-fiction","2015-portfolio","trope-companion-animal","status-owned","genre-science-fiction","free-ebook","tbr","dragons","0050","single-shorts","should-try-to-read","review-done","short-story","shortlist","audio-obtained-ss","sf-hard","shorts","own-to-read","science-ficton","must-read","literatura-norteamericana","cuentos","ciencia-ficci-n","antologias","kindle","novellas-short-stories","1940s-1950s-sf-golden-age","novella-shortstory","misc-sf","kindle-ebook","ciencia-ficcion","biblioteca","wants-list","politics-power-and-history","to-be-sorted","cordwainer-vance-zelazny-and-esque","1954-1969","aaaaaaaa","fiction-sci-fi","sci-fi-series","novels-100","audio-obtained-lvss","audio-books","aa-to-be-sorted"],"content_available":true,"n_authors":1},{"content_name":"96.txt.utf-8","isbn":"1600961630","original_title":"The Monster Men","author_name":"Edgar Rice Burroughs","images_urls":[],"year":1929,"images":["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/56/The_Monster_Men.jpg"],"id":95,"category":"Text","plot":"Cornell University professor Arthur Maxon, who has been experimenting in the creation of artificial life, travels with his daughter Virginia to one of the remote Pamarung Islands in the East Indies to pursue his project. Their departure is noted with interest by a young man, Townsend J. Harper, Jr., who is quite taken with Virginia and determines to find out where they are going. In Singapore, Maxon commissions Dr. Carl von Horn to take them the remainder of the way to their destination in his yacht the Ithaca, and then to assist him in his experiments. On the island the group fights off a pirate attack and builds a fort.\nMaxon and von Horn begin their experiments, growing several living creatures in chemical vats, humanoid but mindless and ugly. Maxon hopes Experiment Number Thirteen will result in a perfect human being, and in his fanatic obsession plans to wed Virginia to this ultimate creation. Von Horn retains a more realistic viewpoint and hopes to marry her himself, leading to friction. Meanwhile, locals including Budadreen, one of von Horn’s crewmen, and Muda Saffir, leader of the pirates, conspire against the scientists, who they believe are hiding treasure. They are watched closely by Chinese cook Sing Lee, who recognizes the pirate.\nExperiment Number Thirteen indeed appears to result in a physically perfect man, but as soon as the scientists discover this an emergency distracts them. Experiment Number One has escaped and abducted Virginia. Maxon, von Horn and Sing Lee pursue the monster, only to find it dead at the hands of Number Thirteen, also escaped from the lab in the wake of the scientists’ departure. Thinking Virginia still in danger, von Horn attacks the creature and is nearly killed himself, but is spared by Thirteen when Virginia pleads for his life. Ignorant of the handsome stranger’s origin, the girl finds herself attracted to him.\nMaxon and von Horn return Thirteen to the lab and begin educating him. Von Horn privately discloses to Virginia Maxon's plan to wed her to one of his creatures, while concealing it is her rescuer to whom she is to be wed. Separately, he informs Thirteen of his artificial origin. Both recipients of his confidences are horrified. Thirteen, or Jack, as he is now called, is convinced that he is a soulless monster and that Maxon must be stopped.\nVon Horn absconds with Virginia while Jack goes to confront Maxon, while Budadreen and six crewmen steal a chest they believe holds Maxon’s wealth. Muda Saffir’s pirates attack the compound and appropriate the chest. Jack, reconsidering his rage, defends Maxon and Sing Lee against the pirates. Virginia rebuff’s von Horn’s advances and falls in with Budadreen, who takes her captive and sails off in von Horn’s yacht. Von Horn, since his effort to turn Jack against Maxon has failed, releases the other eleven monsters against them. Jack overawes the creatures and gains control of them, but Maxon, apparently regaining his sanity, turns on him and drives him away.\nThe Ithaca is wrecked in a gale, and Budadreen and his men swept overboard; later the drifting hulk is boarded by headhunters. Jack and the eleven monsters search for Virginia and find the yacht in the harbor, when it is boarded by Muda Saffir's pirates, the monsters attack them. Saffir takes Virginia and flees the battle in his prahu; the monsters, capturing another prahu, pursue them.\nHaving witnessed these events from hiding, von Horn returns to Maxon, who offers him his fortune and Virginia if he can save her. Jack and his monsters overtake and fight the pirates in Borneo, resulting in six monsters and many of the pirates killed, but Saffir, still holding Virginia, escapes up river in his boat. The monsters join with Barunda and a crew of captive Dayaks and resume pursuit. Meanwhile, Saffir has bungled a rape attempt against Virginia and been shoved overboard by her; his lieutenant Ninaka assumes command. He stops at a native village, hides the chest and Virginia, and when Jack arrives conspires with Barunda to have the natives lead him astray. He then recovers his contraband and continues up river; Virginia ultimately escapes by diving off the boat.\nMeanwhile, Von Horn, Maxon and Sing Lee sail to Borneo, encounter the Ithaca, and enlist the Dyaks to take them to Muda Saffir. The latter, having survived his dip in the drink, flags them down. He and von Horn make a secret deal and continue up river without Maxon, who is stricken with fever. Jack's band, lost, encounters an orangutan band after fighting off more Dyaks. Finding one of them has captured Virginia, they fight the apes. Von Horn, Muda Saffir and a group of native warriors happen on the battle and spirit off the unconscious Virginia; Sing Lee, following, sees all. Von Horn's group and Sing Lee go back to Maxon, who is recovering. Von Horn presses his suit with Virginia.\nNinaka and Barunda fall out; Barunda is murdered, but this drives Ninaka ashore. Ninaka buries the chest lest it encumber his escape. Von Horn and a couple Dyaks, returned from delivering Virginia to her father, witness this. Afterwards von Horn kills his companions to keep the secret of the treasure to himself and flees back down river, narrowly missing Muda Saffir heading the other way with two war prahus; Saffir has again abducted Virginia. She escapes again and falls in with Jack and his surviving monsters; spotted by the pirates, they flee, one of the monsters dying to cover the retreat while Jack carries Virginia to safety. Making his stand in a small canyon, he casts boulders down on their pursuers until they retreat. He promises the girl he will take her back to her father, but soon after is stricken with a fever. She tends him in his delirium.\nMaxon, von Horn, and Sing Lee search for Virginia, and come across the two just as Jack's fever breaks. Von Horn shoots Jack, but Sing Lee disarms him, stopping him from finishing him off. Von Horn finally reveals to Virginia that Jack is Number Thirteen, but she decides she loves Jack regardless. Then Sing Lee declares Jack is not a monster after all, but an amnesiac he had found drifting in a lifeboat and substituted for Maxon's failed experiment. He then exposes the crimes of von Horn, who flees into the jungle. An American naval vessel arrives; it turns out to be seeking von Horn, a deserter, to arrest him. The pursuit finally ends at the site of the buried \"treasure\", which von Horn has dug up; his headless body is found next to the opened chest. It had contained books, not treasure, and von Horn's native accomplices were evidently upset.\nThe Maxons and Jack leave Borneo on the navy ship, and Jack's memory returns. He is conveniently revealed as Townsend Harper, the wealthy (and single) young man who took an interest in Virginia at the beginning of the book. Wedding bells are plainly not far off.","genres":[],"copyright":"Public domain in the USA.","title":"The Monster Men","wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monster_Men","found":true,"year":-1},"average_rating":4.25,"rating_count":392,"goodreads":{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107188.The_Monster_Men","found":true},"similar_books":["Dwellers in the Mirage","Almuric","Dare","The Defiant Agents (Time Traders/Ross Murdock, #3)","Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan: The Land That Time Forgot","Lost Legacy","Planets of Adventure","The Door Through Space","The Czar Of Fear (Doc Savage, #22)","The Complete H.P.

When the Robots revolt, killing all but one of their masters, they must attempt to learn the secret of self-duplication.

R.U.R. stands for Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti (Rossum’s Universal Robots). However, the English phrase Rossum’s Universal Robots had been used as the subtitle in the Czech original. It premiered on 25 January 1921 and introduced the word \"robot\" to the English language and to science fiction as a whole.\nR.U.R. quickly became famous and was influential early in the history of its publication. By 1923, it had been translated into thirty languages.\nThe play begins in a factory that makes artificial people, called roboti (robots), from synthetic organic matter. They are not exactly robots by the current definition of the term: they are living flesh and blood creatures rather than machinery and are closer to the modern idea of clones. They may be mistaken for humans and can think for themselves. They seem happy to work for humans at first, but a robot rebellion leads to the extinction of the human race. Čapek later took a different approach to the same theme in War with the Newts, in which non-humans become a servant class in human society.\nR.U.R. is dark but not without hope, and was successful in its day in both Europe and North America.","classes":["to-read","plays","science-fiction","sci-fi","classics","drama","czech","fiction","favorites","currently-reading","maturita","school","classic","dystopia","play","scifi","czech-literature","sf","dystopian","robots","owned","theatre","theater","20th-century","thï¿½ï¿½tre","favourites","1920s","books-i-own","czech-authors","read-in-czech","literature","sci-fi-fantasy","czech-lit","speculative-fiction","povinnï¿½-četba","ebook","povinna-cetba","czech-books","modernism","for-school","science","maturitnï¿½-četba","e-book","i-own","translated","fantasy","sf-masterworks","kindle","fantasy-sci-fi","audio","eastern-europe","českï¿½-literatura","apocalyptic","philosophy","read-in-2015","teatro","owned-books","plays-to-read","in-czech","library","school-reading","beletrie","ebooks","cz","to-buy","college","robotics","czech-author","capek","scifi-fantasy","translation","to-school","wish-list","klasika","eastern-european","penguin-classics","translations","utopia-dystopia","4-stars","read-in-2016","ciencia-ficcion","robots-ai","sci-fi-and-fantasy","speculative","scripts","tšehhi","to-read-fiction","sf-fantasy","classic-sci-fi","čeština","read-2014","read-in-2014","ciencia-ficciï¿½n","stand-alone","default","artificial-intelligence","classical-literature","sff","europe","must-read"],"content_available":false,"n_authors":1},{"content_name":"29809.txt.utf-8","isbn":"154488124X","author_name":"Various","images_urls":["http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/cover.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_001.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_002.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_003.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_004.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_005.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_006.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_007.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_008.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_009.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_010.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_011.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_012.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_013.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_a.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_b.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_b1.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_c.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_d.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_d1.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_e.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_f.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_g1.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_h.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_h1.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_i.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_i1.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_j.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_l1.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_m.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_n.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_n1.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_o.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_o1.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_p.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_r.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_s.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_s1.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_t.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_t1.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_u.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_w.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_w1.jpg","http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29809/29809-h/images/image_y1.jpg"],"year":1930,"id":100,"category":"Text","genres":[],"copyright":"Public
